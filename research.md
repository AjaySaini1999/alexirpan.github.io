This is not a standard research page.

I like research a lot, but research is also really hard. Due to confidence
issues, I didn't apply to PhD programs this year. If you want to read
my more complete thoughts on this, you can read this blog post CITE.

For now, I'm not at the position where people would be looking up my
research, but I'm still proud of the work I did. I also haven't given
up on academia just yet, meaning I need a way to signal my research
abilities.

I have no publications, and one submission which will get rejected
with high probability. (I estimate 98% reject chance.) So, instead
this page contains anything I've done that is "researchy".
