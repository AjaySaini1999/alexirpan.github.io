*Last updated January 21, 2016*

I've read a lot of webcomics in my time on the Internet. A lot of comics aspire to make
people laugh. There's nothing wrong with that, some of my favorite comics are purely
for comedy. But sometimes, a comic does more. They can be shallow, they can be deep.
They can be beautifully drawn, they can be beautifully written, they can be terrifying
they can be sweet. The strongest will do a bit of everything on their crazy journey.

Much like web fiction, webcomics are all self-published and run on donations, merchandise,
and Patreon. Unfortunately, this means good webcomics are hard to find, which can be
a death sentence for content creators. Here are webcomics I recommend, in the hopes that
it'll help excellent content creators keep their lightbulbs on for just a bit longer.
If not that, then at least it'll give you something interesting to read.

I intend to write more in-depth reviews for some of these recommendations.
To stop this page from getting too unwieldy, **every recommendation must either
link to a full blog post review or be at most three sentences long.**

I broadly divide webcomics in story-driven ones and gag-a-day ones. You should start
story-driven ones from the first page. You can start gag-a-day ones from wherever.

Comics in each category are ordered roughly by how much I liked them, but every comic
on this page is worth checking out.

# Overall Favorites

*The top story based and gag based webcomic.*

**Gunnerkrigg Court**, by Tom Siddell

Updates: Monday, Wednesday, Friday

Link: [here](http://gunnerkrigg.com/?p=1)

Don't let the first page fool you, the art style quickly evolves, and then keeps
evolving chapter after chapter. A fantastic blending of a Neil Geiman-esque world and
Harry Potter-esque characters, told over a series of standalone chapters and long-running
story arcs. If you like science, fantasy, mystery, mythology, or really anything, this
comic has something for you.

**Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal**, by Zach Weiner

Updates: Every day

Link: [here](http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php)

SMBC is one of the biggest webcomics around, and for good reason. It's one of
the "nerdy" webcomics, pulling material from philosophy, physics, chemistry, math,
and economics. Usually cynical and often insightful, but be prepared for lots of
dick jokes.

# Story Based

**Cucumber Quest**, by Gigi D.G

Updates: Whenever, but averages 2-3 updates a week.

Link: [here](http://cucumber.gigidigi.com/cq/page-1/)

If you've played the *Paper Mario* series, you'll like this comic, because it's
basically *Paper Mario* in webcomic form. Plays RPG conventions straight while snarking
about it all the way. The art style is very clean, and is just as complicated as it needs to be.

**Problem Sleuth**, by Andrew Hussie

Updates: N/A, completed

Link: [here](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=4)

Andrew Hussie is much more famous for Homestuck, and even though I like Homestuck more,
I recommend reading Problem Sleuth first to see if you'll like his style of storytelling.
A parody of old school adventure game logic that eventually evolves into a surprisingly
awesome JRPG parody. Runs entirely on internally consistent surreal humor, with lots of
animated gifs to boot.

**Homestuck**, by Andrew Hussie

Updates: On hiatus, but the author hopes to finish by April 13, 2016.

Link: [here](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6)

Once called The Ulysses of the Internet, Homestuck is a labyrinthe story set in a world
that rewards incredibly deep analysis of its setting.
It takes a while to get through the slow Act 1, but eventually you'll catch yourself
thinking about stable time loops, the rules guiding resurrection, and the incredibly
blurred fourth wall.
With static images, animated gifs, Flash animations, and interactive
games, Homestuck uniquely feels like a story that could only be told online.

**Darths & Droids**, by The Comic Irregulars

Updates: Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday

Link: [here](http://darthsanddroids.net/episodes/0001.html)

A comic that runs on a simple premise: what if *Star Wars* didn't exist, and the story
was actually made up on the fly by a roleplaying group and their annoyed game master?
Initially makes fun of D&D cliches, but over time you realize it's also a comic about
the roleplayers playing the characters. Well written and deceptively complex; some plot
lines are foreshadowed years in advance.

**The Adventures of Dr. McNinja**, by Chris Hastings

Updates: Monday, Wednesday, Friday

Link: [here](http://drmcninja.com/archives/comic/1p1/) for the very start, [here](http://drmcninja.com/archives/comic/13p1/) for the small reboot in color. I recommend staring from the black and white
comics because they have important continuity, but the color pages are closer to what the comic
is like now.

Dr. McNinja has punched many things, but among them are: giant lumberjacks, Dracula, dinosaurs,
and vengeful ghosts. Runs on the Rule of Cool, where anything goes if it is awesome enough, but
also takes everything about its world seriously, which makes it bizarrely beliveable.
Despite the premise, the comic has surprising emotional heft; it's not just about explosions.

**Lackadaisy**, by Tracy Butler

Updates: Very rarely, about 1 update every 2 months. RSS highly recommended.

Link: [here](http://lackadaisy.foxprints.com/comic.php?comicid=1)

A ragtag band of misfits tries to keep a once-thriving speakeasy alive in the city
of St. Louis. Oh, and they all happen to be anthropomorphic cats. Historically accurate,
with engaging characters and some of the best art I've ever seen (which unfortunately
contributes to the very slow update schedule.)

**Helvetica**, by J.N. Wiedle

Updates: Irregularly, but no faster than once a week and usually slower. RSS highly recommended.

Link: [here](http://helvetica.jnwiedle.com/2011/06/24/and-so-it-begins/)

When you die, you wake up in the afterlife with no memory of your past life, and the first
words out of your mouth are your name. *Helvetica* is a story about how hard it can be to
forget the past and find peace of mind. Life is hard, but death is too...

# Gag Based

**xkcd**, by Randall Munroe

Updates: Monday, Wednesday, Friday

Link: [here](http://xkcd.com/)

I suspect this needs no introduction. A comic about math and science, with
some of the nerdiest jokes on the internet. Expect lots of commentary on space, physics,
and current hot topics in technical fields.

**Dinosaur Comics**, by Ryan North

Updates: Every weekday

Link: [here](http://qwantz.com/index.php)

A comic where the only thing that changes between each strip is the text.
It's very hard to describe Ryan North's sense of humor, and you'll need to read it for
yourself to see if you like it or not. Lots of silliness, lots of dry humor, some
linguistics, and the occasional analysis of Batman.

**PhD Comics**, by Jorge Cham

Updates: Irregularly, but about 1 update a week.

Link: [here](http://phdcomics.com/comics.php)

A comic about the adventures of grad students in academia. Meaning, a comic
about people failing to do research while questioning why they came to grad school
in the firsst place. It's all in good fun, except for the parts that hit a bit too close to home.

**Nedroid Picture Diary**, by Anthony Clark

Updates: Very rarely, the author does coloring work for several other webcomics now.

Link: [here](http://nedroid.com/)

The adventures of Reginald the bird, Beartato the bear, and Harrison the shark, as well
as a few other characters. It's very minimalistic and very dry in its humor, and although
some are duds, the ones that hit are uproariously funny. I recommend starting with
[Party Cat](http://nedroid.com/2009/05/party-cat-full-series/) and [200 Bad Comics](http://www.nedroid.com/bcpage1.htm).
