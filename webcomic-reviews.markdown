*Last updated January 22, 2016*

I've read a lot of webcomics in my time on the Internet. A lot of comics only look
to make people laugh, and although that's a laudable goal, my favorite comics
try to do just a bit more. Some are beautifully drawn,
some are beautifully written, some are terrifying, some are sweet.
The strongest will do a bit of everything, and bring you along for the ride.

Much like [web fiction](/webfictionrecs/), webcomics are self-published and run on donations, merchandise,
and Patreon. Unfortunately, this means good webcomics are hard to find among the
sea of alternatives, which can be
a death sentence for content creators. Here are webcomics I recommend, in the hopes that
it'll help people keep their light bulbs on for just a bit longer.
If not that, then at least you'll have something interesting to read.

I intend to write more in-depth reviews for some of these comics at a later
point.
To stop this page from getting too unwieldy, **every recommendation must either
link to a full blog post review or be at most three sentences long.**

Webcomics are broadly classified as story-based or gag-based.
You should start story-based ones from the first page to get all the continuity.
You should start gag-based ones from the most recent page, because many comics
take a while to find their stride.

Comics in each category are ordered roughly by how much I liked them, but every comic
on this page is worth checking out.

# Overall Favorites

*If you only have time for a few of these comics, read these two.
The top story based and gag based webcomic.*

**Gunnerkrigg Court**, by Tom Siddell

Updates: Monday, Wednesday, Friday

Link: [here](http://gunnerkrigg.com/?p=1)

Don't let the first page fool you, the art style evolves after chapter into
something picturesque.
Imagine if Neil Geiman wrote Harry Potter, and you'll get something close
to *Gunnerkrigg Court*. Blends science, fantasy, mystery, and mythology into
a series of standalone chapters and long-running story arcs.

**Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal**, by Zach Weinersmith

Updates: Every day

Link: [here](http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php)

*SMBC* is one of the biggest webcomics around, and for good reason. In its
quest to make fun of humanity, it pulls material from philosophy, physics, chemistry, math,
and economics. Cynical, insightful, and not above doing a dick joke on occasion.

# Story Based

**Cucumber Quest**, by Gigi D.G

Updates: Irregularly, about 2-3 updates a week.

Link: [here](http://cucumber.gigidigi.com/cq/page-1/)

If you've played the *Paper Mario* series, you'll like this comic, because it's
basically *Paper Mario* in webcomic form. Plays RPG conventions straight while snarking
about it all the way. A very clean art style with vibrant characters that pop
off the page.

**Problem Sleuth**, by Andrew Hussie

Updates: N/A, completed

Link: [here](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=4)

Andrew Hussie is much more famous for *Homestuck*, and even though *Homestuck*
is the better work, I recommend starting with *Problem Sleuth* to see if
you'll like his style of storytelling.
A parody of old school adventure game logic that progresses into a surprisingly
awesome JRPG parody. Drives all its humor from internally consistent
absurdity.

**Homestuck**, by Andrew Hussie

Updates: On hiatus, but the author hopes to finish by April 13, 2016.

Link: [here](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6)

Once called [the *Ulysses* of the Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLK7RI_HW-E),
*Homestuck* is a labyrinthine story set in a world
that rewards incredibly deep analysis of its setting.
It takes a while to get through the slow starting acts, but eventually you'll catch yourself
asking questions about stable time loops, the rules governing resurrection, and
the incredibly blurry fourth wall.
With static images, animated gifs, Flash animations, and interactive
game segments, *Homestuck* is the one comic that relies on the Internet to
work.

**The Adventures of Dr. McNinja**, by Chris Hastings

Updates: Monday, Wednesday, Friday

Link: [here](http://drmcninja.com/archives/comic/1p1/) for the very start, [here](http://drmcninja.com/archives/comic/13p1/) for the first issue in color.
The author suggests starting from the color pages, I disagree.

Dr. McNinja has punched many things, but here are the big four: a giant
lumberjack, Dracula, a dinosaur, and a vengeful ghost. Runs on the Rule of Cool,
where anything goes if it's awesome enough, but
also takes everything about its world seriously, which makes it bizarrely beliveable.
Despite the premise, the comic has surprising emotional heft and continuity;
it's not just about ninjas and explosions.

**Darths & Droids**, by The Comic Irregulars

Updates: Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday

Link: [here](http://darthsanddroids.net/episodes/0001.html)

What if *Star Wars* didn't exist, and the story
was actually made up on the fly by a role-playing group and their annoyed yet
amused GM?
Initially makes fun of D&D clich√©s and the *Star Wars* plot, but over time
you realize there's a deeper story around the role-players themselves.
Well written and deceptively complex; some events are foreshadowed years in advance.

**Lackadaisy**, by Tracy Butler

Updates: Irregularly, about 1 update every 2 months. RSS highly recommended.

Link: [here](http://lackadaisy.foxprints.com/comic.php?comicid=1)

A ragtag band of misfits tries to keep a once thriving speakeasy alive in the city
of St. Louis. Oh, and they're all anthropomorphic cats. Historically accurate,
with engaging characters and some of the best art I've ever seen (which unfortunately
contributes to the very slow update schedule.)

**Helvetica**, by J.N. Wiedle

Updates: Irregularly, about 1 update every month. RSS highly recommended as well.

Link: [here](http://helvetica.jnwiedle.com/2011/06/24/and-so-it-begins/)

When you die, you wake up in the afterlife with no memory of your past life, and the first
words out of your mouth are your name. *Helvetica* is a story about how hard it can be to
move on and find peace of mind. When death's the same as life, does the
past even matter?

# Gag Based

**xkcd**, by Randall Munroe

Updates: Monday, Wednesday, Friday

Link: [here](http://xkcd.com/)

I suspect this needs no introduction. A comic about math and science that aims towards
a technical audience. Expect lots of commentary on space, physics,
and current hot topics in scientific news.

**Dinosaur Comics**, by Ryan North

Updates: Every weekday

Link: [here](http://qwantz.com/index.php)

A comic where the only thing that changes between each strip is the text.
It's very hard to describe Ryan North's sense of humor, so you should read it for
yourself to see if you like it or not. Lots of silliness, some
linguistics, and the occasional analysis of Batman.

**PhD Comics**, by Jorge Cham

Updates: Irregularly, but about 1 update a week.

Link: [here](http://phdcomics.com/comics.php)

A comic about the adventures of grad students in academia. Meaning, a comic
about people failing to do research while questioning why they came to grad school
in the first place. It's all in good fun, except for the parts that hit a bit too close to home.

**Nedroid Picture Diary**, by Anthony Clark

Updates: Very rarely, the author is busy doing coloring work for other webcomics.

Link: [here](http://nedroid.com/)

The adventures of Reginald the bird, Beartato the bear, and Harrison the shark, as well
as a few other characters. The punchlines are short, the humor is very dry, and
when it hits, it hits hard.
I recommend starting with
[Party Cat](http://nedroid.com/2009/05/party-cat-full-series/) and [200 Bad Comics](http://nedroid.com/bcpage1.html).
