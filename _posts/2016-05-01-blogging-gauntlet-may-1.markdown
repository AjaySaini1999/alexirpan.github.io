Recently, I haven't been updating this blog very often. The biggest factor in
that was that my spring break finished, and every one of my classes decided
they could really get moving now that everyone was back. That meant I was
swamped with final projects until today.

However, that shouldn't be an excuse not to blog. In fact, for about the
first two weeks after coming back, I found myself wanting to write blog
posts about various silly observations I'd had. I knew I was busy, and
that blogging had to take a backseat, but it was nagging and nagging me.
To quote **Art & Fear** again,

> Artists don't get down to work until the pain of working is exceeded
> by the pain of not working.

Yet as the weeks passed by, I was feeling less motivation to keep writing.
I always had an excuse. This presentation is due the 14th. I need to
fix my research code in time to run experiments. I have a paper to write.
These were all incontrovertible facts, and the consequences were similarly
unavoidable: my blogging habit slowly dissipated. Gaming and Internet
browsing rushed into the void, and soon I was back where I started.

Classes have finished at Berkeley, meaning I'm free for the first time
in a long while. But in just over a month, I'll be starting a full-time
job, and I'm worried I'll once again have reasons not to blog. I'll be
too tired, I'll be too drained. Those are the words I'll tell myself
to justify not writing, and sometimes they will be true and sometimes
they won't, but the outcome will be the same either way.

So, with a new month comes a new start and a new opportunity. I've been
planning this for a while, and I am proud to present: **The Blogging
Gauntlet of May 2016!**

(Quietly, in the distance, a [fanfare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKy0SP8ScAk)
plays. Then the crickets start chirping.)

* For every day of May, I will write and post at least 500 words.
* If I write more than 500 words for a day, that's great! I still have to write
500 words the next day. There is no rollover, there is no surplus, and there
is no buffer. Each of those 500 words must be written between
12:00:00 AM and 11:59:59 PM.
* I am allowed to write on whatever I want. I am allowed to write as awfully as
I want. Posts do not have to be well-edited. If they are, it means I had time
to do so.
* To make this actually matter to me, **every day I fail to write 500 words,
I will donate $20 to charity.** I haven't decided where, but I'll probably
distribute them based on what [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org/) recommends.
