*I was last at Berkeley in Spring 2016, and it's possible things have changed
since then, but I'm aiming to represent the viewpoints as accurately as
possible.*

On Tuesday, UAW Local 2865, the union representing TAs across the UC system,
[announced](https://uaw2865.org/cal-tas-win-multi-million-dollar-grievance-victory/)
that UC Berkeley would pay $5 million in back pay to TAs. The story is getting
picked up by a few places: [The Chronicle of Higher Education](http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Berkeley-TAs-Are-Awarded-Millions-in-Ba...ay-The-Chronicle-of-Higher-Education.pdf),
, [Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/01/16/arbitrator-says-uc-berkeley-owes-its-computer-science-tas-5-million),
local Bay Area news outlets like [The Mercury News](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/15/cal-tas-declare-victory-in-multi-million-grievance-fight/)
and [Santa Cruz Sentinel](https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2020/01/15/cal-tas-declare-victory-in-multi-million-grievance-fight/),
and even some national outlets like [Vice](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v74d7b/teaching-assistants-say-theyve-won-millions-from-uc-berkeley).

In aggregate, these articles actually do a pretty good job of explaining the
details, and a few of the different viewpoints, but as someone who TAed
at Berkeley, in an 8 hour position, I've been feeling very conflicted.


Why Does the University Owe Back Pay?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

At UC Berkeley, all TAs are paid an hourly wage. On top of this, all TAs who
work at least 10 hours / week are entitled to childcare benefits and
fee remission. The important part is the fee remission. If you TA for 10
hours a week or more, you are paid $7,500 for the semester on top of
your hourly wage, which covers the in-state tuition for the semester.

In the CS department, most TA positions used to be 10 hr / week or
20 hr / week positions. Starting around 2015-2016, many of these TA positions
started turning into 8 hr / week appointments, making them ineligible for
fee remission. Doing so let the department get more TA hours for the
same amount of budget, since the pay that would have gone to fee remission
gets turned into TA hours instead. They saw a welfare cliff, and decided to
get as close as they could without going over.

After this started spreading, the union filed a grievance against the University. Now, to be clear,
nothing the University did was illegal. The contracts were clear that
8 hr / week positions were not eligible for fee remission, and the classes
I TAed for made sure this was clear as well. However, the union argued that
the University was effectively violating the spirit of the negotiated
fee remission, by turning jobs that needed benfits into ones that didn't.
You can make a similar argument for companies turning full-time jobs into
jobs that don't require them to offer health-care benefits, for example.

The arbitrator ruled in favor of the union, and the University has agreed
to cooperate with the decision.


Why Did UC Berkeley Start Doing This?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the last few years, UC Berkeley has had a perpetual funding problem. This
plus exploding interest in CS courses plus competing offers from industry
have put tons of strain on the CS department's budget.

In 2016, in light of protests by graduate student instructors (GSIs), there was a
town hall to discuss the CS department's budget, attended by professors,
members of the union, and much of the CS department's teaching staff,
myself included. Throughout the town hall, the professors made it clear
they supported the GSI protests, and would have hired TAs at 10 hr
appointments if they had the funding for it. The Berkeley CS department
does get some funding, but nowhere near enough to meet demand. The department
does heavy outreach for donor support, using this to shore up the budget,
but this isn't seen as sustainable. They've repeatedly asked the Berkeley
administration to give them more funding, and have consistently seen it go
to non-academic areas, like althetics or more administrative jobs.

One obvious solution was to restrict enrollment, instead of using this
8 hr TA loophole. However, CS enrollment was already heavily impacted.
Some lower division courses literally have thousands of students.
Professors teaching these courses said
they were happy to have the class be as large as possible, as long as there
was TA support for it. At some point, the department decided they would
make the classes bigger by using 8 hr TA appointments to make the numbers
work. My understanding was that they wanted this to be a one-time deal,
but like the donor support, this trick became a normalized part of the budget.


Were These 8 Hour TA Appointments Bad?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

It heavily depends on who you ask. Eight hour TA jobs were almost
exclusively held by undergraduates, and in fact undergrads make up
the majority of the CS department's TA staff.

This tends to surprise people, and can be interpreted as vaguely
exploitative. Let me explain why it wasn't.

Undergrads started getting hired as TAs
because Berkeley didn't have enough grad student TAs to meet course
demand. However, some
professors have
found that undergraduate TAs do a better job than graduate
TAs, because undergrads *actually took the course they were TAing.*
For lower division courses, graduate and undergraduate students know
the material equally well, but grad students learned it at a different
university, so they're generally less familiar with how Berkeley
teaches the course.

Additionally, some undergrad TAs would TA the same course several
years in a row. This happened less with grad students, since after they
met their TA requirements, they would switch to focusing on research.
The increased continuity from undergrads made it easier to preserve course
teaching culture and knowledge across years.

Finally, the increase in undergrad TAs was good for graduate school
applications, since it gave more undergrads a connection to a professor
who could eventually write them a letter of recommendation.

From my point of view, these undergrad TA positions were a net
positive for everyone involved.

None of this is directly related to the union's grievance. Fee remissions
will be paid back to both undergrad TAs and graduate TAs. It is, however,
indirectly related. One side effect of hiring many 8 hour TAs is that
*you have to hire more undergrads*.
More students got to hold TA positions, and had someone to ask for a letter of
recommendation at grad school application time.

You could argue this is [Goodharting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law)
in action, since each professor gets less time to evaluate each TA. Maybe all
it did was rubber-stamp more letters that said "this student helped me
teach a course", without actually saying anything useful for graduate
school admissions. But in this instance, I don't the incentives are entirely
unaligned. Part of TAing is to help students practice teaching. I taught
one section a week in my 8 hour TA appointment, while 20 hour TAs taught two. I'm sure
I would have learned from the 2nd section per week, but the marginal benefit
from 0th to 1st is much bigger than 1st to 2nd, and splitting the TA load across
more people meant a lot more people got that 0th to 1st experience.

My view is that the CS department set a bad precedent that wasn't entirely bad.
Eight hour TAs are not a good fit for the entire UC Berkeley campus, since it's
pretty clear that if it was universalized, no one would get fee remission or
childcare benefits. However, for the unique situation the CS department was in,
the outcome wasn't terrible. As much as I've mentioned budget issues, the CS
department has it pretty good, relative to other departments. Donors for CS
are pretty rich, and I know several students who funded their education through
tech company summer internships. Strong students could get
[$7,000 a month](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/internships-entry-level-jobs-2019/)
or more during the summer, often with a housing stipend, and that could cover in-state tuition,
housing, and food until the next summer if you planned your budget right,
even with the insanity of Bay Area rent. Most departments do not have this
luxury.

The problem was that departments that didn't have these luxuries would and
were tempted to adopt similar policies, in a bid to fix budget problems of there
own. I think it's good for the university to have 8 hour TA appointments go away,
but I think it's bad for the CS department to lose them.


What's Going to Happen Next?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's still uncertain, but here's my understanding based on discussion in
the Berkeley Facebook student groups.

First of all, existing TAs working less than 10 hours per week will continue
to work the same amount. However, they'll receive fee remissions. There is
a contract negotiated by the union that prevents TAs from losing their jobs
in the middle of the semester, so for now, this semester will play out as
before.

Starting next semester, TA hours are going to get more expensive. To minimize
cost per hour, departments are incentivized to hire fewer TAs that work longer
hours. Fee remission is a fixed cost paid once per student per semester, so you
want that student to work as much as you can hire them for. In CS,
this historically means 20 hours per week, but I've recently
learned that Berkeley has 30 hour / week appointments in other departments,
so it could go even higher. Fewer undergrad TAs will get to talk to professors,
and fewer undergrads will sign up in the first place. If the only TA options were
20 hour appointments, I likely wouldn't have taken any of them in my senior
year, due to other time commitments.

The adminstration will either need to allocate more TA budget, or CS class sizes
will need to shrink. Historically, I've lost a lot of faith in the UC system
and expect it to raise the budget by a token amount that doesn't cover the
shortfall. CS class enrollment was already effectively at capacity with the
8 hr / week loophole, so it has to drop. The math I saw was that four 8 hour TAs
cost the same as one 20 hour TA. If the budget doesn't increase, a shift to
20 hour TAs means 62.5% of the teaching hours as last semester. This is pretty
crazy, I have no idea how they'll even figure out enrollment.

I'd like the union to negotiate higher pay per hour, in exchange for fee
remissions, because one of the big lessons is that welfare cliffs can lead to
bad consequences.
If this happened, it would fix much of my issues with the
current status quo, since professors could go back to offering many smaller
TA appointments. However, it seems very unlikely the union will do this,
and I'm not even a student anymore, so it's not like I have much say in this.

As with pretty much any story combining "UC Berkeley" with "budget", it's going
to be a huge mess. Hopefully, this made it clearer why this decision was not a
clear black-and-white victory for the workers, as much as some want to
treat it that way.
