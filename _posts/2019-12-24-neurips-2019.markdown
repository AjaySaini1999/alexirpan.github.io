Ostensibly, I'm on vacation. However, I both have a bit of insomnia and
a bit of inspiration, and I haven't written a post in a while, so buckle
up, I'm weighing in on ML stuff again. (As always, you are free to
ignore my opinions if you want to.)

I've been to three NeurIPS: 2016, 2017, and 2019. So, no, I haven't really
been around that long. NeurIPS 2016 was my first academic conference ever,
so I didn't really know what to expect. By NeurIPS 2017, I'd been to a few
and could confidently say that NeurIPS 2017 felt too big. By NeurIPS 2019,
I was no longer sure that was true.

Before going to NeurIPS 2016, I got some advice from senior researchers:
if you aren't skipping talks, you're doing it wrong. I promptly ignored
this advice and tried to attend every talk I could, but now I get what
they were saying.

A lot of people attend conferences to meet up with the people they only
see at conferences. The more conferences you go to, the more networked
you become, and the more this happens. The talks and papers will,
in principle, always be there. The in-person conversations, not so much.
It's not that they can't happen through video calls, it's that the conference
environment provides a much lower activation energy to scheduling these
things.

Early on in your research career, it makes sense to go to talks. You know
less about the field and you know fewer people. As you become more senior,
it makes less sense to go to talks. It's more likely you know the topic
of the talk already, and you know more people, so their value goes down
compared to the
research conversations had over drinks or lunch. I believe the organizers
know this. Ever wonder why there
are so many coffee breaks, and why they're all much longer than they'd
need to be if people were just getting coffee? Important, valuable
meetings are happening during those coffee breaks.

In this model of a research conference, all the posters, accepted papers,
talks, and so on are backgroud noise. They exist as the default option
for people who don't have plans, and that default option is critically
important to keeping everything going, but they're not the point of
the conference. The point of the conference is for everyone in the
research community to gather at the same place at the same time.
This is a very similar dynamic to
fan conventions, if you've been to any of those.

If you take this model as true, then NeurIPS's unofficial status as
the biggest ML conference is incredibly important. If you could only
go to one conference each year, you'd go to NeurIPS, because everyone
else is trying to go to NeurIPS.

And if it's the place to be, shouldn't NeurIPS be as big as it needs to
be?

The main source of tension in this argument is that NeurIPS and the
rest of ML is growing, but the growth is coming from different sources.

Year over year, NeurIPS has been growing much faster than the PhD
programs that should ostensibly be feeding into it. The growth is
coming from increased interest from the broader data science community
- a community that is much larger and of a different makeup than the
ML research community, and that's where it gets tricky.

I said NeurIPS is about networking, but the unsaid question is:
networking between who? It started as networking between researchers,
because the makeup of attendees at the time was mostly researchers,
and it's been shifting ever since deep learning hype took off.

Maybe machine learning conferences in the middle of its Eternal September
moment. The influx of new people used to be small enough for the culture
to absorb them without much change. That isn't true anymore - the rise
in attendance is pushing the culture to a new, unexplored place.

Who is NeurIPS for? Is it for the established researchers to talk shop?
The newer researchers trying to present their work and build a career?
The enthusiast looking to get into ML? Right now, it's for all of them,
but I don't know how designed the current
NeurIPS experience it. Until told otherwise, I'll believe it's something
that grew organically, and continued to evolve with some prodding from
the organizers to try to keep everyone happy, a daunting task I wouldn't
wish on anyone.

I've portrayed NeurIPS and other conferences as networking locations
first, but they're also submission venues where people are submitting
and presenting their peer-reviewed work. Much has been said about how
bad the peer-review process is, but it's hard for me to believe it's
entirely uncorrelated with a paper's merit.
