Back in 2008, Randall Munroe, creator of xkcd, put up this comic.

In a perfect storm of bikeshedding, this comic was by far his most
controversial ever. He got more email from this than his
endorsement of Obama. It seemed that
everyone had a different opinion about fruit, and wanted to tell
Randall exactly how wrong he was.

For a while, I've wanted to know what the average fruit opinion is.
One day, I decided to stop being lazy and make a survey for this.


Survey Design
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Participants rated each fruit's difficulty and tastiness on a scale
from 1 to 10. I shared the survey among my Facebook friends, the xkcd
subreddit, and the SampleSize subreddit. One of my friends reshared
the survey to the UC Berkeley Computer Science group.

Along the way, I got some comments about the survey's design. My surveyed
population is biased towards people who frequent those subreddits, and
placing the xkcd comic at the start of the survey biases participants.
It's true, but in my defense, I wanted to give context
for why I was conducting this survey, and the survey is about
fruit. Literally fruit. It wasn't supposed to be a big deal.


Analysis
----------------------------------------------------

In total, I got over 1300 responses.
Before going into results, fun fact: everyone's fruit opinion
is indeed unique. No two responses had the exact same fruit rating. To be fair,
it would be more surprising if this weren't true, since I asked for
ratings on over 20 different fruits.
In fact, it would have been incredibly strange if I did find two people with
the exact same rating.


Results
================================================

The five most difficult fruits are

1. Pineapple
2. Pomegranate
3. Honeydew
4. Grapefruit
5. Cantaloupe

Pineapple and pomegranate are the clear losers here. Honeydew, grapefruit, and
cantaloupe are all roughly tied in difficulty.

The five easiest fruits are

1. Seedless Grapes
2. Blueberries
3. Strawberries
4. Bananas
5. Red Apples

No surprises here.

Now, onto taste. The five worst tasting fruits are

1. Lemons
2. Grapefruit
3. Tomatoes
4. Honeydew
5. Cantaloupe

As a fellow grapefruit hater, I approve. As a fan of cantaloupe, I question
people's judgment.

The five best tasting fruits are

1. Strawberries
2. Seedless Grapes
3. Peaches
4. Blueberries
5. Mango

Personally, I'm surprised seedless grapes was 2nd, while seeded grapes
was 13th. It's not a small difference either - here are the two histograms.

Seems like it was hard to disentangle the taste of the fruit
from its difficulty.

Finally, controversial fruits. I measured this by fitting a normal distribution
to the cloud of replies for each fruit. The distribution is fitted to
difficulty and tastiness simultaneously.
A fruit is controversial if its normal distribution has large variance.

The five least controversial fruits are

1. Strawberries
2. Seedless Grapes
3. Oranges
4. Blueberries
5. Tangerines

By definition, this shouldn't be surprising.

The five most controversial fruits are

1. Tomatoes
2. Grapefruit
3. Mango
4. Watermelon
5. Lemons

![Tomatoes](/public/fruit-opinion/tomatoes.png)
{: .centered }

Yep, the tastiness of tomatoes was definitely controversial - this is
almost like a uniform distribution, compared to the histograms for
grapes.
Also, congratulations to mango, for being both controversial and in the top
five tastiest fruits.


Graphs
=============================================================

I had to bend the numbers a little bit here. It turns out the average
tastes for each fruit are a lot closer than their average difficulty.
Stretching the taste-axis exaggerates the relative difference
between fruits without changing their ranking.

Here's the same plot overlaid onto the original comic, if you want to
compare and contrast.

Finally, here's the plot with confidence ellipses from the fitted
normal distributions, to visualize controversy.
Don't read too much into the absolute size
of each ellipse. Only a small fraction of responses actually lie within
each ellipse, but drawing a 90% confidence ellipse would have made
the ellipses overlap more than they already do.

and the code used to create these graphs can be seen [here](https://github.com/alexirpan/alexirpan.github.io/blob/fruit-opinion/_scripts/fruit_grapher.py)
