title:  "So There I Was, Buying My Little Pony Merchandise in Italy"

For Thanksgiving, my family went on a trip to Rome. It was pretty cool!
There's something special about visting a city that is literally
thousands of years old. It is one thing to read about the Renaissance,
and it is another thing entirely to see a sculpted fountain in person,
realizing that it predates the Declaration of Independence by over
300 years, and it's *right there*.

The one downside is that although
my parents liked the scenery, they weren't the biggest fans of
Italian food. They didn't dislike it, but, well, let me put it this way:
the only restaurant we visited multiple times was a Chinese restaurant.

To be fair, the Chinese restaurant catered to Chinese exchange students,
meaning their Chinese food was authentic and actually pretty good.
Still, I wasn't expecting to eat Chinese food in Rome, and I *especially*
wasn't expecting eating Chinese food multiple times in Rome.

But I digress! During the trip, we visited a supermarket to buy some
fruit. While there, a family member pointed out these boxes.

I was against buying it. They argued the following.

* According to the packaging, there was "a surprise inside".
* It only cost 2 Euros.
* Buying MLP merchandise in Italy is intrinsically funny.

I bought two boxes.

Let's take a closer look. The front and back have the same picture,
but the two sides are different.

The first thing I noticed was that the character art looked...off, somehow.
In what world does Fluttershy wink like that? In what world does Twilight
smirk like that. Expression-wise I'm pretty sure neither has made that
face in the show, and it feels out-of-character for both of them.
Fluttershy seems too reserved for a playful wink. Twilight seems too nice for
a knowing smirk.

Rainbow also looked off, and after staring at it a while, I
figured out why. Normally her mane hangs over her *left* eye, but
here it hangs over her *right*.

*Literally unbuyable.* I'm only kind-of joking, actually.
Look, here's my view: fans have the right to call out shitty merchandise.
Like, if you're going to monetize your show, you should at least have your
merchandise reflect what your show looks like!
Don't even tell me that the target audience of young girls won't care.
I suspect the target audience *does* care. One, I believe children
are more perceptive than people think. Two, when you're a kid, you don't
have as much going on in your life, which makes it easy to obsess over the
details of your Saturday morning cartoons. The moment they changed
Ash Ketchum's voice actor in *Pokemon*, I was **done** with that show.

Take *Brave* as a case study.
The goal of *Brave* was to create a Disney princess
that avoided the gender stereotypes of the old Disney princesses.
The movie succeeded. The marketing didn't.

The marketing made Merida slimmer, made her a bit older, removed her
bow, and made her hair less curly. Anecdotally, my Facebook feed had a few
comments from parents, saying their daughter didn't like it because "her
hair wasn't as curly", and "it's not the same Merida as the movie."
(You can read comments from Brave's director
[here](http://www.marinij.com/general-news/20130511/brave-creator-blasts-disney-for-blatant-sexism-in-princess-makeover), if you're interested in further ranting.)

The details matter. Don't mess them up.

Opening the box produces this.

![Box contents](/public/mlp-italy/muffin.jpg)
{: .centered }

What looked like a chocolate muffin, and a few pony cards.
The chocolate muffin...was not that good. Derpy would be ashamed.

![Derpy hooves](/public/mlp-italy/derpy.jpg)
{: .centered }

(She delivers mail and makes good muffins. That's the joke.)
{: .centered }

Okay, so it's not actually a muffin. It's
"[panettoncino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panettone) with chocolate chips",
But my headcanon is that if Derpy can make good muffins, she can make good
panettoncino too.

Let's take a closer look at these cards.

![Front of cards](/public/mlp-italy/card_fronts.jpg)
{: .centered }

(Card fronts.)
{: .centered }

![Back of cards](/public/mlp-italy/card_backs.jpg)
{: .centered }

(Card back. It's identical for all of them.)
{: .centered }

Awwwwww, they're so cute! I have no issues with the art here. But wait a
second, there's only 5 cards. Isn't it supposed to be the Mane 6?
Where's Applejack? She's not on the front. She's not on the back.

Speaking of which, is Applejack even on the box?

Scroll up if you want. She isn't.
**Applejack doesn't appear anywhere on or in this box.** Every other
pony in the Mane 6 is there. The top bar has plenty of side characters...
and no Applejack.

![Side characters](/public/mlp-italy/sidecharacters.jpg)
{: .centered }

(I recognized all these characters by heart. Don't judge me.)
{: .centered }

...and no Applejack.

![Sad Applejack](/public/mlp-italy/sad_applejack.png)
{: .centered }

Strike the "Chinese food in Rome" thing. This right here is
a **What the hell were you thinking?** moment.
Applejack certainly isn't that popular, but come on,
she's part of the main ensemble! There are plenty of Applejack fans!

![There are dozens of us! DOZENS!](/public/mlp-italy/dozens.gif)
{: .centered }

This is funny at a meta-level,
because people like to joke Applejack is "the best background pony",
but it's sad for fans that have to see her getting
treated as a second-level citizen.
Either this is a mistake of colossal proportions, or Applejack is
just that unappealing of a character. I'll be generous and go with
the former.

I've bought other MLP merchandise, but it's primarily been
fan-created merchandise. Fan merchandise tends to match the quality
I expect out of merchandise, because it's made by people *who actually care
about getting the details right.*

Look, Hasbro, just do it better next time, alright?
