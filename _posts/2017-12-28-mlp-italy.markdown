For Thanksgiving, my family went on a trip to Rome. It was pretty cool!
There's something special about visting a city that is literally
thousands of years old. It is one thing to read about the Renaissance,
and it is another thing entirely to see a sculpted fountain in person,
realizing that it predates the Declaration of Independence by over
300 years, and it's *right there*. The one downside is that although
my parents liked the scenery, they were not the biggest fans of
Italian food. They didn't dislike it, but, well, let me put it this way:
the only restaurant we visited multiple times was a Chinese restaurant.

To be fair, the Chinese restaurant catered to Chinese exchange students,
meaning their Chinese food was authentic and actually pretty good.
Still, the whole time, I was trying to figure out why we were eating
Chinese food in Rome.

But I digress! During the trip, we visited a supermarket to buy some
fruit. While there, a family member pointed out these boxes.

I was against buying it. They argued the following.

* According to the packaging, there was "a surprise inside".
* It only cost 2 Euros.
* Buying MLP merchandise in Italy is intrinsically funny.

I bought two boxes.

Let's take a closer look.

PICTURES / VIDEO

I was originally against buying it because the character art wasn't
show accurate. Rainbow's mane doesn't
look like that! Since when has Fluttershy ever winked like that, or
Twilight smirked like that? Isn't that somewhat out-of-character for
both of them? *Literally unbuyable.*

Then I remembered that there was a MLP movie, which was animated
differently. It might have been *movie accurate*. Rainbow Dash
in particular is closer to her movie model than her show model.

PICTURE

All this focus on the character model is only kind-of a joke.
Look, here's my view: as a fan, I have
the right to call out shitty merchandise. Like, if you're going
to monetize your show by capitalizing on people liking your characters,
*you should at least make good merchandise*,
Don't even tell me that the target audience of young girls won't care.
I suspect the target audience *does* care. One, I believe children
are more perceptive than people think. Two, when you're a kid, you don't
have as much going on in your life as an adult does, and that means
that the details matter even more.

As a case study in this, there was big uproar over merchandise for
*Brave*. The goal of *Brave* was to create a Disney princess
that avoided the gender stereotypes of the old Disney princesses.
The movie succeeded. The marketing didn't.

The marketing made Merida slimmer, made her a bit older, removed her
bow, and made her hair less curly. Anecdotally, I read accounts of girls
not liking the new design, because "it's not the same Merida as the
movie." (You can read comments made by Brave's director
[here](http://www.marinij.com/general-news/20130511/brave-creator-blasts-disney-for-blatant-sexism-in-princess-makeover), if interested.)

The details matter. Don't mess them up.

Opening the box produces this.

What looked like a chocolate muffin, and a few pony cards.
The chocolate muffin...was not that good. Derpy would be ashamed.

(She delivers mail and makes good muffins. That's the joke.)

Honestly, I wasn't expecting the muffin to be good, so that's fine.

(Also, it turns out I'm an uncultured swine, because it isn't a muffin,
it's "[panettoncino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panettone) with chocolate chips."
Sorry.)


Let's take a closer look at these cards.

PICTURE

Awwwwww, they're so cute! But wait a second, there's only 5
cards. Isn't it supposed to be the Mane 6? Where's Applejack?

Taking a look at the back of the cards, she isn't there either.

PICTURE.

Speaking of which, is Applejack even on the box?

VIDEO

She isn't. **Applejack isn't on this box at all.** Every other
pony in the Mane 6 is there. Even in the top bar, there are plenty
of side characters. Roseluck, Mysterious Mare-do-Well, Spike, Trixie,
the Cutie Mark Crusaders...and no Applejack.

Strike the "Chinese food in Rome" thing. This right here is
a **What the hell were you thinking?** moment.

PICTURE OF APPLEJACK?

Applejack certainly isn't that popular, but come on,
she's part of the ensemble! There are plenty of Applejack fans!

![There are dozens of us! DOZENS!](/public/mlp-italy/dozens.gif)
{: .centered }

Either this is a mistake of colossal proportions, or Applejack
doesn't get much love from marketing. This is funny at a meta-level
because people like to joke Applejack is "the most popular background
character", but it's really sad for fans that have to see her getting
treated as a second-level citizen.

I've certainly bought other MLP merchandise, but it's primarily been
fan-created merchandise. Fan merchandise tends to match the quality
I expect out of merchandise, because it's made by people *who actually care*.

That panettoncino? It doesn't look it was made by people who cared.
