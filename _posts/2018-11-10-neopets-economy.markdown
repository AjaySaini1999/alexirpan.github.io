What is Neopets?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Neopets](www.neopets.com) is a website about, well, Neopets, which are cute
animals you can own as pets. The main currency of Neopets is Neopoints,
abbreviated NP. You earn NP from playing Flash games, getting lucky from random
events, and playing the market.

It was biggest in the early 2000s, then faded from relevance, but it's still
around. I like to check it out now and then, mostly for nostalgia reasons.
It's pretty interesting. Depending on where you look you can *see* the evolution
in web design between the old and new parts of the site. (I should warn you
that Neopets currently doesn't support HTTPS and it sends passwords in
plaintext, so be careful.)

What you do in Neopets is up to you.
There's no clear goal to the game, and I think that's why it manages to stick
around. Everyone who's stuck around has found something that pulls them in.
Some just like the
Flash games. Others become collectors of weird items. A few (like myself)
get into the battling scene, leveling up their pet at the Neopets training
schools and saving up Neopoints for powerful weapons.

Like I said. It's all up to you.

What isn't up to you are the laws of supply and demand. In the end, most goals
cost Neopoints, and any game that's run for 18 years is bound to have its share
of economic stories.


That Time Neopets Changed Pet Art, Creating a New Scarce Resource
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2007, the Neopets team standardized Neopet artwork.
All Neopets of a species would have the same pose, regardless of color.
This was done to reduce the art load for features like clothing. With
a standard pose, the clothes can simply be overlaid on top of the Neopet, reducing
the combinatorial complexity of the art assets. Many outfits are only buyable
with NeoCash, the pay-to-win currency, so there are some pretty clear monetary
reasons involved.

Some users got angry. Many were drawn to their Neopets
because of what they looked like, and some felt that the new artwork lost some
of the charm and individuality of the old art. As a comparison, here is
some old artwork for the Darigan color.

Here is the new artwork for the same set of Neopets.

![jubjub new](/public/neopets-economy/new_darigan/jubjub.png)
{: .centered }

You can see that the style is preserved, but the poses are more homogenized.
Personally, I don't think this is a big deal, but I'm not big on pet aesthetics.

Not all the new art was ready at launch time, so some pets kept their old art. As
an apology of sorts, the Neopets team made conversion of these pets optional.
These pets became known as UC pets, for unconverted.

Since new UC pets
are impossible to create, there's a fixed supply, and where there's a fixed
supply, there's speculators.
Owning a UC pet is a big deal. Some genuinely prefer the old art, whereas others
simply treat them as a
valuable bargaining chip in the pet trading market.

You can read more about this topic from [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/2xpejk/so_whats_the_deal_with_unconverted_neopets/)
and [the Neopets wiki](http://neopets.wikia.com/wiki/Unconverted). When
researching this, I even found a page where [you can buy UC pets](https://neopointsdeals.com/neopets/buy-unconverted-neopets/), with classifications based on how well the Neopet is named. I
find this ridiculous, yet excellent.


That Time People Abused a Duplication Glitch and Crashed the High-End Economy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2014, Neopets was sold from Viacom to JumpStart. During the transition period,
the site was lagging horribly, and a bunch of things...just stopped working.

> Games: broken (HSTs not reset)
> 
> Restocking: broken (only restocking once an hour or so)
> 
> User shops: a little broken (overstocking)
> 
> Battledome: broken forever (not really, it's just a little glitchy)
> 
> Keyquest: still broken (broken since transition)
> 
> Contests (Art Gallery, Random Contest, etc.): broken (submissions don't work)
> 
> Galleries: broken (you can add/remove but you can't rank)
> 
> Petpages: NEIN NEIN NEIN (you cannot edit petpages. at all. no petpages for you.)
> 
> Neomail: bit messy (neomails displaying as "read" instead of "replied")
> 
> Wishing Well: worst genie ever (has not granted wishes in days)
>
> Employment Agency: everyone is on state benefits (no job listings)
> 
> Guilds: pretty broken (rank names and layouts can not be edited)
> 
> Pound: having numerous issues. (adopting neopets is not a good idea right now)
> 
> Our hearts: broken (TNT WHYYYYYYYY)

{: .centered }

During the lag, a few users discovered that if you sent a bunch of requests at
a fast enough rate, the servers would get confused and duplicate items.
Several Neopets items cost hundreds of millions of Neopoints, and a few trolls
started duplicating items and selling them at deliberately low prices.

Credit to [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/8wyqpl/neopets_history_the_2014_dday_dupe_day/) and [this article](http://neopointsdeals.com/neopets-dupe-day-2014/)
for documenting some of the madness. First they auctioned some morphing
potions for cheap.

![Island Krawk](/public/neopets-economy/dupe_auction.png)
{: .centered }

(Current price: 820,000 NP)
{: .centered }

Then, they duplicated powerful Battledome items.

![Shop dupe](/public/neopets-economy/dupe1.png)
{: .centered }

(Current price: 28.5 million NP for Thyoras Tear, hundreds of millions for Super Attack Pea)
{: .centered }

It got worse when people started releasing scripts to automate dupe attempts.

![Dupe program](/public/neopets-economy/dupe_program.png)
{: .centered }

You have to imagine how disappointed some cheaters were. Here they are, trying
to silently exploit a glitch to make millions, and then the trolls show up and
ruin everything by making the exploit *super obvious*. Like, *ugh*, couldn't
they exploit their MMO-breaking bug in peace? The glitch got patched
immediately.

And by immediately, I mean 4 days later.

Also, they didn't rollback the servers. Instead, they banned the abused, removed
all the obvious-looking duplicates, and warned that anyone taking advantage of
the glitch may be banned. It can take months to hear back from Neopets support
to appeal your ban, thanks to understaffing and a massive backlog. There was
some paranoia.

![Please remove](/public/neopets-economy/dupe_remove.png)
{: .centered }

There are reasons not to do a rollback. It's a nuclear option that's very
disruptive for other users. However, it's also one of the few ways to guarantee
invalid items are no longer in circulation. Users adopted smell tests, based on
whether the price was too good to be true, or if the account seemed too young to
own a valuable item. This only goes so far. Once a dupe gets laundered through
a few users, it's hard to identify it as a fake.

Ironically, by avoiding the nuclear option, the Neopets team ended up
creating a radioactive fallout around high-end items, since buying them came with
the risk of losing your account. It took several months
before people felt safe buying these items. If you check prices, it's obvious
that some dupes are still out there, but what can you do?
Super Attack Peas used to be over 1 billion NP and now they're about one-fourth
of the price. That's just a fact of life now.


That Time Neopets Decreased Sale Friction and Prices Dropped Accordingly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a long, long, long, looooooooooong time, the max price of items in user shops
was 99,999 NP. For anything more expensive, you had to sell on the Auction House
or Trading Post. In practice, the Auction House is only used to close already
agreed-upon deals from the Trading Post, leaving the Trading Post as
the de-facto selling ground.

When I played more actively, I found this very annoying, because it takes so
much longer to buy items from the Trading Post. Here's how you buy items from
shops.

* Go to the Shop Wizard and search for your item.
* It gives you listings in order of lowest price.
* Buy cheapest one. The transaction is instant.

Here's how the Trading Post works.

* Go to the Trading Post and search for your item
* It gives you listings where people write how much they want, except most people just say "neomail me offers", which makes it hard to figure out the market price.
* You haggle with the seller in an NeoMail back-and-forth.
* You get the item a few hours or days later, depending on how much your activity
overlaps with the other user.

In short, there's a lot of friction. There's also information asymmetry. When
a deal closes, it isn't publicized. Only the people involved in that transaction know the final
terms.
Sellers ask for more NP than the item is actually worth,
because it's hard to prove them wrong, and it's up to the buyer to propose
the right price. The Shop Wizard is buyer-favored. The Trading Post is seller-favored.

Recently, the max shop price was increased from 99,999 NP to 999,999 NP. It was
a great change that improved accessibility of several items, leading to price
drops across the board for several items.

I was selling Turned Tooths at the time, and it was
pretty amazing to see all the Turned Tooths disappear from the Trading Post,
then reappear in the Shop Wizard at 60% of the asking price. I knew they weren't as
valuable as everyone wanted them to be, but it was something else to see it
happen live.


That Time a Book Got 1000 Times More Expensive Because of Charity
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a secret about Neopets: 99% of the items are useless.

Despite this, some useless items still have high prices, because of their
rarity. Neopets has a built-in rarity system, explained [here](http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=item_rarities_explained).
For our purposes, the important rarities are rarities 1-99. These items are
sold form NPC shops, and the rarity defines how often that item is in stock.
Rarity 99 items restock very rarely, giving them an allure of their own.
Many users like filling out their Galleries with all the rarity 99 items they
can get.

Let's talk about the [Charity Corner](http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=charity_corner). It's a yearly event where you can
donate gifts to Neopians who need it. Awwwww.

The way it works changes each year, but here's how it worked in 2015 and 2017.
Donatable items fell in three rarity bands: r70-79, r80-89, and r90-99. The
Charity Corner only accepted a few category of items, one of which was books.
For every five books you donate, you get a random item sampled from the rarity band you donated.
For example, you donate five rarity 90 books, and you get a random item from
rarity 90 to 99.

This sampling wasn't weighted by rarity, so this gave decent chances of getting
a rarity 99 item, and a lot of cheap items have rarities in the low 90s.

No surprises for what happened next: users began buying out the cheapest rarity 90
items they could find, swarming to the next cheapest item once users adjusted
their prices accordingly.

[JellyNeo](http://www.jellyneo.net/) tracks historical logs of item prices. Here's the 2015 price log for
[Realm of the Water Faeries](https://items.jellyneo.net/item/37910/), a rarity 92 book. Can you guess when Charity
Corner ran that year?

![Price increase from 45 NP to 50000 NP](/public/neopets-economy/charity2015.png)
{: .centered }

A price spike form 45 NP to 50,000 NP. No big deal, just a 1000x increase.
Here's the 2017 spike, with a more modest spike of 100x from 300 NP to 30,000 NP.

![Price increase from 300 NP to 30000 NP](/public/neopets-economy/charity2017.png)
{: .centered }

I didn't participate in Charity Corner, but it ended up affecting me when I
was shopping for Battledome weapons. I wanted to buy a
[Wand of the Dark Faerie](http://battlepedia.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=showweapon&id=14896&idb=1).
It used to cost 350 million NP, way more than I ever thought I could achieve.
These wands are given out for reaching level 50 in the Jhudora quests. Part of
the reason they're so expensive is because you need several rarity 99 items
to reach level 50. The increase in rarity 99 items from Charity Corner
ended up decreasing the price to [40 million NP](https://items.jellyneo.net/item/14896/price-history/).
Still a lot, but a lot more manageable.


That Time A User Donated a Billion Neopoints to Help Save the Economy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

All MMO economies are defined by their sources and sinks. How does in-game
currency get created, and how does it get deleted?

Take MapleStory, a game I played a lot in my youth. Monsters create money when
they die. NPC shops remove moeny when they sell you healing potions.
Whenever you trade with a user, a small percentage of the transaction is taken as tax.

Monsters and NPCs are parts of all RPGs. But why is there a user tax?
The more monsters killed, the more money there is
in the economy. In MapleStory, the in-game currency is called Mesos. When there
are more Mesos, each individual Mesos has less buying power. The tax helps
keep inflation in check by removing Mesos from the overall economy.

In Neopets, Neopoints enter the system through Flash games, and leave from NPC
shops. There's no transaction tax, so inflation is only held in check by
whether users spend money at NPC shops or not.

Remember that NPC shops restock items of varying
rarities. The NPC price for rare items is much lower than the true market price,
leading to a practice called restocking. You refresh a shop page until
rare items appear in stock, buy them for cheap, then sell them to users at
a much higher price.

As a kid, I thought restocking was magical. I played Neopets with my friends
at the local library, because my local library had a super fast Internet
connection. In a Neopets restock war, milliseconds matter. It was basically
high-frequency trading, except performed by millions of children instead of bots.

As an adult, I now recognize the profit from restocking is basically the
equivalent of scalping. There's arbitrage between the NPC market and the
user market and you're getting compensated for the time spent.

From a game design point, scalping is actually good for the game, since it gives
new players another way to earn Neopoints. But the low NPC shop prices meant
that NP wasn't leaving as quickly as it needed.

Users with enough economics knowledge to recognize the problem petitioned the
Neopets team to add more NP sinks to the game. They obliged. Here are two I
like a lot.

**The Lever of Doom:** Pulling this lever makes you lose 100 NP. That's all it
does.

![Lever of Doom](/public/neopets-economy/leverofdoom.gif)
{: .centered }

Why would you even pull this lever? Well,
every pull has
a small probability of giving you a Lever of Doom avatar you can use on the
Neopets message boards. That was enough to get avatar hunters to spend
millions of NP chasing the avatar.

![Lever of Doom Avatar](/public/neopets-economy/leveravatar.gif)
{: .centered }

Would you pay for this? I wouldn't. But you do you.


**The Hidden Tower Grimoires:** The Hidden Tower is the most expensive NPC
shop in the game, selling items for millions of NP. Unlike other shops, all
Hidden Tower items are always in stock. This reverses the dynamic - most
Hidden Tower items are buyable from users at a slight discount from the base
price. Bad for inflation, since users don't spend money at the NPC store.

The Hidden Tower Grimoires are books, and unlike the other Hidden Tower
items, they're entirely untradeable. You can only buy them from the Hidden
Tower, with the most expensive one costing 10,000,000 NP.
Each book grants an avatar when read, disappearing on use.

![100,000 NP book](/public/neopets-economy/book1.gif)

{: .centered }

Remember the story of the [I Am Rich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich)
iOS app, that cost $1000, and did literally nothing? Buying the most expensive
Grimoire for the avatar is just pure conspicuous consumption.
I think these avatars were actually a pretty smart move. They target the top 1%
by creating a new status symbol.

Alone, these two weren't enough, so in 2010, the team decided to go all out, with
a month-long **Save the Wheels Campaign**.

![Save the Wheels](/public/neopets-economy/savethewheels.jpg)
{: .centered }

The Wheels are a site feature where you pay a small NP fee to spin a wheel to
get prizes. They've been around since the start of the game, and they needed
a visual rework.

Seeing an opporunity, the rework was branded as a renovation project. Users
who donated Neopoints would receive thank-you gifts from the Neopian Conservation
Society, and the top 10 donaters would be listed on a public leaderboard.
The most expensive thank-you gift required donating 2,000,000 NP at once.

There are lots of user stories about people who come back to the site, dig
through their storage, and discover an item (like a stamp they got from
an event ten years ago) is now worth millions of Neopoints, because it's part
of a stamp album that stamp collectors want and they were only given out
ten years. Any time there's an event that gives out items which will never be
given again, you can be sure that some users will get as many as they can as
a long-term investment strategy.

You can see the final tally at the offical [Neopets page](http://www.neopets.com/savethewheels/)
for the event. Users donated 12,371,694,534 NP in total, with the top user
donating over a billion NP by themselves.

![Billion NP](/public/neopets-economy/billion.png)
{: .centered }

And okay, sure, it's not like they asked users to donate NP for the good of the
economy. It was in exchange for stuff that speculators wanted. But I still
find the entire event very amusing.


\* \* \*
{: .centered }

There isn't really a point to this post. It was mostly an excuse for me to dig
up Neopets history. But if I had to make one, it would be that it's very, very
hard to escape economics. It has
this nasty habit of showing up everywhere you look.

There have been other posts about the Neopets economy. There's
[this one about inflation](https://www.themarysue.com/neopets-economy/),
and [this one about the dangers of unrestricted capitalism](https://medium.com/nimbly-aware/the-bourgeoisie-online-a-review-of-the-neopets-economy-4963d0a0f845).

In one sense, yes, there's definitely a Neopets top 1%, that barters in
millions while others are earning 5000 NP a day. As noted by [this editorial](http://www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=468018&week=412), this top 1% barely interacts with the
Neopets proletariat. (I certainly never expected to write about the Neopets
proletariat, but here we are.)
It's definitely disheartening to realize how much more the wealthiest users have.

On the other hand, Neopets doesn't cost anything to play. Feeding your Neopets
costs 5 NP a day, and they don't die if you don't feed them.
The Flash games are entirely free to play. The strongest
criticism of unrestricted capitalism is that some are forced into terrible
conditions to earn enough to live, but this just isn't a thing in Neopets, since
there *isn't* any cost to living.

Sure, not everyone on Neopets has what they want. But Neopets is a game. It
only works as a game *because* it requires effort to get many of things it
offers. If there's no challenge in getting things in the game, why would
anyone play it?

A similar sentiment was explained in this profanity-filled, slightly NSFW
[Zero Punctuation review of Minecraft](https://youtu.be/4wgQvij3rVE?t=256).

> If you can just clap your hands and summon fifty explosive barrels, the spectacle

I'd hesitate to generalize any lessons from the Neopets economy to the real
world economy. There are too many differences for the comparison to have value.
If anything does transfer, it's that we like having goals, something to aim for
that takes work to achieve. And, it's that not everyone can get what they want.
Not the happiest ending, but what do you expect out of the dismal science?
