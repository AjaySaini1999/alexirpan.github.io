yet.)

**From:** recruitment@shellstone.com  
**To:** rainforest@gmail.com  
**Subject:** Congratulations!

After reviewing your interview feedback, we're proud to extend you an offer
to join the Illuminati! Our offer letter is attached. **Please make a decision
within the next 2 weeks.**

You are free to discuss this offer with other people, but **do not tell them
it is an offer from the Illuminati.** If pressed, tell them it's an offer from
a Silicon Valley startup in stealth mode.

If you have any questions or concerns about the offer, let us know!

**Dulcet:** hey, how've you've been?  
**Rainforest:** hey. Alright, I guess. Still making a decision on that
offer I was talking about  
**Dulcet:** holy shit how many times have we gone over this? JUST TAKE THE OFFER  
**Rainforest:** not that simple  
**Dulcet:** okay look, I get that there are a bunch of reasons not to take it  
**Dulcet:** but from what you've been able to tell me, it sounds amazing  
**Dulcet:** and I think if you don't take that offer, you'll be wondering for
the rest of your life  
**Dulcet:** it sounds like a once in a lifetime chance. You don't pass those up.  
**Rainforest:** I'll think about it.

We've heard that you signed our offer. Congratulations!

Your official start date is a month from now, but to speed-up the
onboarding process, do the following before orientation.

* Familiarize yourself with PGP, Tor, browser fingerprints, and other parts of computer
security. Start using these services in your everyday life.
As an Illuminati employee, you are now the target for a wide variety
of actors. Our rule of thumb is, assume the NSA is looking for you, and act
accordingly. (The NSA shouldn't be looking for you thanks to our contacts,
but let's just say we aren't the only secret society in the world.)

* Create an account on the Official Illuminati forums. An agent will deliver
the URL and authentication details in person sometime in the next two days.
All communication from now will be done through the Illuminati forum.
**For your username, do not use anything tied to your real name, or the
names of any of your existing online accounts.**
Doing so is grounds for termination of your employment.

* Upon doing so, you'll have level 0 security clearance.
This gives you the minimal access required to access the employee
handbook and the new employee subforum. Your clearance will increase to
level 1 after your orientation.

Your orientation mentor is *SilentNight*, who has been CCed on this email.
You can direct further questions to SilentNight. He/she is here to help.

From here on out, we will no longer reply to emails sent to
recruitment@shellstone.com.

Lastly, welcome to the Illuminati! We know many companies say they're changing
the world or making it a better place, but at the Illuminati, we mean it.

Hey, I just finished moving two days ago. I did this after the interview
process so I think you have my old address, should I send you my new one?

Don't worry about it, we know you moved and already have your new address.
Keep an eye out for that agent! They like to troll the new hires.

**The Illuminati**

Hello **Tundra**  
Total time logged in: 0 days, 0 hours, and 4 minutes

**Illuminati Forum > Newcomers (level 0) > How did the agent troll you?**

**AdminBot** (beep boop)

Share your onboarding story here. How did they deliver forum access to you?

**\> Tonne** (New Hire)

I was planting tulips in my garden. Dug out a hole to place the tulip, and found
a buried capsule with a piece of paper in it.

**\> Heliotrope** (New Hire)

Went out for a jog, accidentally bumped into somebody, found the note in my
pocket aftewards. Guess that accident wasn't an accident after all.

**\> PPP** (New Hire)

Got a package from Amazon that I didn't order. Box had a giant Matryoskha doll.
Turns out the bottom level was rigged with firecrackers,
set to go off when opened. After I finished freaking out I found the contact info
inside.

**\> Tundra** (New Hire)

That doesn't sound nearly as bad as what happened to me.

You wouldn't believe how proud I was when I came up with that idea. Glad it
worked as well as I hoped :)

At least one of us is happy :(

**New Hire Orientation**

**QwerG:** Hi all! Welcome to your Illuminati orientation. Can you send a message
if you're here?

**Tundra:** here

**Tonne:** yep

**Heliotrope:** yo

**PPP:** here

**QwerG:** And that's everyone. Now, you probably noticed there a delay between
sending your message and it getting displayed. That's because all your messages
go through a moderation queue. This lets us control who gets to talk when.

**QwerG:** I have to cover, so let's get going.

**QwerG:** For starters, I have a video for all of you.

(*Four hours later*)

**QwerG:** Let's adjourn for a lunch break. I've disabled chat moderation. Be back
here within an hour.

(Direct Message request from Heliotrope)

**Direct Message: Heliotrope**

**Heliotrope:** What crap.

**Tundra:** lol

**Tundra:** I mean, what did you expect?

**Heliotrope:** I took this job because I was tired of corporate bullshit. I
didn't expect secret organizations to have corporate bullshit too.

**Tundra:** bullshit is everywhere

**Tundra:** there's no escape

**Heliotrope:** Look I get that but maybe I wanted just a little bit less bullshit.
I mean, did you see that video? Do you think he even believes it?

**Tundra:** Who's he?

**Heliotrope:** QwerG

**Tundra:** how do you know QwerG's a he?

**Tundra:** They could be a she. Or consider themselves genderqueer.
QwerG could even be a chatbot.

**Tundra:** not like we'd ever know

**Heliotrope:** I kinda like the chatbot angle

**Heliotrope:** would help explain how utterly useless that entire presentation was.

**Tundra:** lol

**Heliotrope:** Just hardcode some pointless corporate platitudes and presto.

**Tundra:** getting food, ttyl

**Heliotrope:** k

**QwerG:** That concludes our orientation session. Congratulations! You're all new
Illuminati employees.

**QwerG:** You now all have level 1 security access, which opens up most of our
secrets. Any burning questions about what we do, what we've done, etc? (Note:
moderation is staying on to keep questions rate-limited.)

**PPP:** Is Queen Elizabeth II a lizard person?

**QwerG:** No

**PPP:** Do lizard people exit?

**QwerG:** yes

**Tonne:** wait what

**PPP:** YES, TOTALLY CALLED IT. KNEW IT HAD TO BE REAL

**Tundra:** wtf are you serious

**QwerG:** Yep. I happen to be one myself.

**Heliotrope:** ...I was going to ask if you were a chatbot, but, uh, okay.

**PPP:** So what's your life like?

**Tonne:** woah woah woah hold up. why should I trust you? Like, why should
lizard people even exist? It's just stupidly unlikely.

**QwerG:** any more unlikely than the Illuminati being a real secret society that's
been controlling world history?

**Tonne:** no that argument's not valid and you know it. Someone here hid a note
in my garden without getting caught, despite me trying to catch them in the
act. I'm getting an actual paycheck from the Illuminati. So I've got all this
evidence the Illuminati is real. I don't have anything similar for you being
a lizard person, besides your claim.

**QwerG:** Okay. First off, you're getting a paycheck from Shellstone.
Maybe everyone you've talked to is a Freemason who's *pretending* to be the
Illuminati. But sure, I get the big picture.

**QwerG:** You have no reason to believe me. But what would
I have to gain by lying about this? If you think hard enough, I'm sure you could
come up with a reason, but it won't be very strong.

**QwerG:** a
