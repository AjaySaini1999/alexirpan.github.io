**From:** recruitment@shellstone.com  
**To:** rainforest@gmail.com  
**Subject:** Congratulations!

After reviewing your interview feedback, we're proud to extend you an offer
to join the Illuminati! Our offer letter is attached. **Please make a decision
within the next 2 weeks.**

You are free to discuss this offer with other people, but **do not tell them
it is an offer from the Illuminati.** If pressed, you can say it's an offer from
a Silicon Valley startup in stealth mode.

If you have any questions or concerns about the offer, let us know!

**Dulcet:** hey, how've you've been?  
**Rainforest:** hey. Alright, I guess. Still making a decision on that
offer I was talking about  
**Dulcet:** holy shit how many times have we gone over this? JUST TAKE THE OFFER  
**Rainforest:** not that simple  
**Dulcet:** okay look, I get that there are a bunch of reasons not to take it  
**Dulcet:** but from what you've been able to tell me, it sounds amazing  
**Dulcet:** and I think if you don't take that offer, you'll be wondering for
the rest of your life  
**Dulcet:** it sounds like a once in a lifetime chance. You don't pass those up.
**Rainforest:** I'll think about it.

We've heard that you signed our offer. Congratulations!

Your official start date is a month from now, but to speed-up the
onboarding process, do the following before orientation.

* Familiarize PGP, Tor, browser fingerprints, and other parts of computer
security. Start using these services in your everyday life.
As an Illuminati employee, you are now the target for a wide variety
of actors. Our rule of thumb is, assume the NSA is looking for you, and act
accordingly. (The NSA shouldn't be looking for you thanks to our contacts,
but let's just say we aren't the only secret society in the world.)

* Create an account on the Official Illuminati forums. An agent will deliver
the URL in person sometime in the next person.
All communication from now will be done through the Illuminati forum.
**For your username, do not use anything tied to your real name, or the
names of any of your existing online accounts.**
Doing so is grounds for termination of your employment.

* Upon doing so, you'll have level 0 security clearance.
This gives you the minimal access required to access the employee
handbook and the new employee subforum. Your clearance will increase to
level 1 after your orientation.

Your orientation mentor is *SilentNight*. If you have further questions,
send a PM or start a chat with SilentNight after completing the sign-up procedure.

From here on out, we will no longer reply to emails from this address.

Lastly, welcome to the Illuminati! We know many companies say they're changing
the world or making it a better place, but at the Illuminati, we mean it.

QwerG: That finishes everything I wanted to cover. I'm restoring chat privileges
to everyone else, and opening the floor to questions. (Note your messages are
going through a moderator queue before getting displayed, so your reply may
show up a bit late.
