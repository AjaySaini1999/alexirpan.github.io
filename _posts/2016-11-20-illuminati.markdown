(Figure out the format later, get the text first.)


We've heard that you signed our offer. We'd like to be the first to welcome you
to the Illuminati! Working for this organization is an experience like no other.

We know your official start date is a month from now, but to speed-up the
onboarding process (and leave room for the fun stuff, like confirming which
theories are true and which are false), here's what you need to do before
orientation.

* Familiarize yourself with common privacy techniques, like PGP, Tor,
and browser fingerprints. Now that you work for the Illuminati, assume the
NSA is actively looking for you. (We have contacts in the NSA to make sure
they aren't, but the NSA is now the least of your worries.) We don't expect
employees to get everything right, so just do your best. At orientation time
we'll patch the gaps.

* Once you feel sufficiently secure, sign up on the Official Illuminati forums,
linked here. All communication from henceforth will be done through either
the forums or our internal chat client.
**For your username, do not use your real name, or the names of any
of your existing online personas.**
Doing so or encouraging others to do so is grounds for termination.

* Once you have created an account and had it verified by your referrer (in
your case, this is SilentNight), you'll have level 0 security clearance.
This gives you the minimal access required to access the employee
handbook and the new employee subforum. Your clearance will increase to
level 1 after your orientation.
Subforums outside of your clearance will not be displayed.
**Subforums will display the clearance needed to access them. Posting
content above this clearnace is grounds for termination.** This is the
most common way people leave the organization - be very, very careful.

If you have further questions, send a PM or start a chat with SilentNight.

Welcome to the Illuminati! Companies like to say they're going to change
the world, but at the Illuminati, we mean it.
