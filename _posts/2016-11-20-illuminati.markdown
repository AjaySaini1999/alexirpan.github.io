(Dates are missing because I haven't figured out what timeline I want
yet.)

**From:** recruitment@shellstone.com  
**To:** rainforest@gmail.com  
**Subject:** Congratulations!

After reviewing your interview feedback, we're proud to extend you an offer
to join the Illuminati! Our offer letter is attached. **Please make a decision
within the next 2 weeks.**

You are free to discuss this offer with other people, but **do not tell them
it is an offer from the Illuminati.** If pressed, you can say it's an offer from
a Silicon Valley startup in stealth mode.

If you have any questions or concerns about the offer, let us know!

**Dulcet:** hey, how've you've been?  
**Rainforest:** hey. Alright, I guess. Still making a decision on that
offer I was talking about  
**Dulcet:** holy shit how many times have we gone over this? JUST TAKE THE OFFER  
**Rainforest:** not that simple  
**Dulcet:** okay look, I get that there are a bunch of reasons not to take it  
**Dulcet:** but from what you've been able to tell me, it sounds amazing  
**Dulcet:** and I think if you don't take that offer, you'll be wondering for
the rest of your life  
**Dulcet:** it sounds like a once in a lifetime chance. You don't pass those up.
**Rainforest:** I'll think about it.

We've heard that you signed our offer. Congratulations!

Your official start date is a month from now, but to speed-up the
onboarding process, do the following before orientation.

* Familiarize yourself with PGP, Tor, browser fingerprints, and other parts of computer
security. Start using these services in your everyday life.
As an Illuminati employee, you are now the target for a wide variety
of actors. Our rule of thumb is, assume the NSA is looking for you, and act
accordingly. (The NSA shouldn't be looking for you thanks to our contacts,
but let's just say we aren't the only secret society in the world.)

* Create an account on the Official Illuminati forums. An agent will deliver
the URL and authentication details in person sometime in the next two days.
All communication from now will be done through the Illuminati forum.
**For your username, do not use anything tied to your real name, or the
names of any of your existing online accounts.**
Doing so is grounds for termination of your employment.

* Upon doing so, you'll have level 0 security clearance.
This gives you the minimal access required to access the employee
handbook and the new employee subforum. Your clearance will increase to
level 1 after your orientation.

Your orientation mentor is *SilentNight*, who has been CCed on this email.
You can direct further questions to SilentNight. He/she is here to help.

From here on out, we will no longer reply to emails sent to
recruitment@shellstone.com.

Lastly, welcome to the Illuminati! We know many companies say they're changing
the world or making it a better place, but at the Illuminati, we mean it.

Hey, I just finished moving two days ago. I did this after the interview
process so I think you have my old address, should I send you my new one?

Don't worry about it, we know you moved and already have your new address.
Keep an eye out for that agent! They like to troll the new hires.
