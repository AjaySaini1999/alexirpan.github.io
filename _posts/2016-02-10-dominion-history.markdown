MAKE UP AN INTRO HERE

It's a long story. To do it right, we need to head back to the very beginning.


    TIMELINE:
    Dominion's original release and reception
    Original online implementation on BSW
    BGGDL
    The rise of Isotropic
        Talk about Council Room too!
        And the fan card contest getting onto the site during April Fool's
    Announcement of an official client by Goko
    Closed Beta
        With security concerns
    Disastrous Launch and bring back into closed beta
    Long span before Isotropic goes down
    Rise of Goko Salvager
    Transition to Making Fun
    Long stall before new version
    Repeated disappointment
    Making More Fun (dll hacking oh my)
    The next new implementation

In 2008, Donald X. Vaccarino (known as DXV or Donald X in the community)
published Dominion. It quickly shot to the top 10 board games on BoardGameGeek.
It's fallen since then, but much like Setters of Catan it's a historically
important board game that sparked many changes.

Now, I'm not going to explain the rules in depth. This post is about
the Dominion community, not the game. However, I do need to briefly explain how
the game works.

Dominion is called a deckbuilding game. In fact, it's usually credited as the
first deckbuilder, inspiring games like Ascension, Puzzle Strike, Star Realms,
and, uh, Deck Builder.

The core idea is that everyone starts with the same deck of cards. On each turn,
people play cards, generate resources, and buy new cards for their deck. As

In Dominion, everyone starts with the same deck of cards. Over the course of the
game, people play cards from their hand to generate money. They use that money
to buy more cards from the supply, making their deck better. (EXPLAIN SUPPLY)

What makes Dominion so replayable is that each set comes with around 25
different Action cards. Each game only uses 10, which makes every game a different
experience. With expansions, the depth becomes ridiculous. But we'll get to
how ridiculous competitive Dominion gets later.

Anyways, Dominion released, and it was a huge hit. It soon grew its own pocket
of fandom in the BoardGameGeek forums. Nascent strategy discussions came and went.
Is Chapel too strong? Does it pass the Silver Test? Over time, people started
coming up with special terms. Big Money, the opening, greening, terminals, Village
Idiot. Over time, strategy discussion started crystallizing around the important
concepts. Engines, rushes, cycling, Cursing. There's a cornucopia of terms (and
the expansion *Cornucopia* brought its own set as well.)

All of this discussion couldn't exist without Dominion Online. In the beginning,
there was Dominion on BrettspielWhet (BSW). I wasn't around for BSW, but by
my understanding, it was clunky and heavyweight. Nevertheless, it was free and
it worked.
