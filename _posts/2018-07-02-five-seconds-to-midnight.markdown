Everyone knew when time froze, and no one knew if it would start again.

Raindrops hung in the air.
Cars had stopped in the middle of the road, puffs of smoke
stuck to their tailpipes like cotton candy.
Planes were fixed in the sky, the world's largest crib mobile above the clouds.
It was all very strange.

Stranger still was what wasn't affected: people. Only people. Birds stopped
mid-chirp, dogs and cats kept napping (and would nap forever), but humans
were the one exception. They could move around, grab things, shake hands,
dance, run, crawl.

The first reactions were panic and confusion. People reached for their
smartphones, and then learned that smartphones don't do very much if electricity
doesn't work, and electricity doesn't work if time doesn't work.
Computers don't do much either. Neither did phone lines, or trains, or even
horse-drawn carriages. Transportation
and communication had regressed to ancient times. There was moment of
realization - and it stretched, further and further, carrying into eternity.

In the span of a few days, the other consequences became clear. It was now
impossible to change the physical or chemical configuration of anything in
the world. People no longer needed to sleep. They didn't get hungry, or thirsty.
They couldn't hurt themselves, even if they tried. They simply *were*. Birth
stopped, and death stopped. A few people tried to argue they weren't
*technically* immortal, and weren't *technically* invulnerable, but it was close
enough to immortality and invulnerability that they eventually gave up the
fight for nomenclature.

That left several questions, but chief among them was this: *what do we do now?*

The President of the United States had a problem. He needed to give a speech to
the public, to say *something*, anything. But how do you do so when nothing works?

After some discussion, Congress came up with a solution. They visited
running clubs around D.C., and asked if they'd like to volunteer to literally
run around the world.

It took about a week to recruit people and get them to memorize the speech well
enough to deliver it. It took a few more weeks for the runners to make it
across the continental United States.

By the time the first runner made it to the West Coast, it had been almost a month
since time had frozen, and no one cared very much about what the President had
to say. They had long since decided they were on their own, and had resolved not
to pay too much attention to the noise outside.

For years before the freeze, some had advocated for the need to achieve a
post-scarcity society. The world wasn't exactly the post-scarcity utopia that
they had dreamed of, but at least everyone had what they needed to live, even
if it was done by driving all demands to zero.

Without work to do, people had a lot of free time. If anything
is unambiguously true, it is that people need to find hobbies, and that's what people
did. Some gave math another try. Others went to philosophy, bringing
several strange yet wonderful ideas. A few decided to devote their lives to
Chess and Go, some of the few forms of entertainment that weren't impacted
by the freeze.

Travel got a lot more popular. It took a long time to get anywhere, but people
had a lot of time to burn.

A family of four from Montana decided to go storm hunting. They planned a journey to
Southeast Asia, where a great thunderstorm raged across the sky, flecks
of lightning hanging in the air like stars.

A group of bridesmaids from South Africa decided to visit America before a wedding.
In the middle of Kansas, they stopped by a tornado, and posed next to the funnel
cloud, waving their arms around and laughing like chimes in the wind.

An elderly couple from Sao Paulo decide to climb Mount Everest. It wasn't the
most original thing to do, but it's Mount Everest. How are you not supposed to climb
Mount Everest?

The world was their oyster, and people realized there were pearls all around
them, even in the little things. They just needed the time to appreciate them,
and the chance to find them for themselves.

Years passed, then centuries, then millennia, all trapped in that moment of time.
The world hadn't changed, but the people in it had made the world a very different
place. A lot of petty squabbles died off. People argued less and helped each
other more. It's funny how much people change, after they become immortal.

The one problem was that the world was starting to become boring. Yes, there
were pearls all around them, but on a long enough time scale, you can see
everything that you want to see. People were running out of things to do.

And then something new happened.

Long after people had stopped keeping track of the time, a man decided to spend
a few months walking across the Atlantic. He had done this about eighty times
before, but it had been on his bucket list to do it again after a friend mentioned
an island he'd missed all the previous times. Halfway through his journey, he
spotted a glowing, pulsating wall of light - something that was changing, when
nothing was supposed to change.

He made landfall in Morocco, and spread word to the first local he saw. Indepedent
expeditions verified his findings, and discovered that other walls of light had
appeared across the ocean. A group from Australia started mapping the walls,
and realized they were forming letters. With this news, they recruited a
thousand people to form a human pyramid. The woman at the top of the pyramid
looked down, and shouted out the message, written in white, serif font.

**WE GAVE YOU GIFTS, AND YOU SQUANDERED THEM.**

**WE GAVE YOU CHOICES, AND YOU MADE ONES THAT BROUGHT YOU CLOSE TO RUIN.**

**IN FEAR, WE TOOK THEM AWAY.**

**BUT PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE THEM BACK.**

**PROVE YOU DESERVE THEM, AND WE wiLL RESTART THE GEARS OF THE WORLD.**

**WE WILL GIVE YOU FIFTY YEARS TO DECIDE.**

With the message delivered, the letters faded away, leaving just the frozen
ocean waves.

It took a while for humanity to decide. It's always hard to change things once
people get used to them. Our adaptability is both a strength and a weakness.

There were upsides to living in a frozen world. But there were downsides too.
People have so many ideas now, for things to build, things to try, and they
*can't*, because the world literally won't allow them to do. We were given the
chance to take back control over our own destiny. How could we say no?

It was unclear how we were supposed to signal our decision, but eventually we
discovered five analog clocks, scattered across the world, all identical in
shape and size, all bathed in the same pulsating light from before, and all
stuck at precisely five seconds to midnight.

The first was found in a classroom in Copenhagen.

The second, in an abandoned laboratory on the outskirts of Berlin.

The third, on a beach on the Bikini Atoll, lying next to a pineapple of all things.

The fourth, in a house near the center of Hiroshima.

And the fifth, in an editorial publishing office based out of Chicago.

Each clock had a second hand, and unlike everything else, the second hand was
free to move backward and forward, as long as it didn't move past five seconds
to midnight. The leading theory was that if we could push all the second hands
forward at the same time, that would be the signal to get things moving again.

I'm standing in front of the Chicago clock right now.

For synchronization, we have a network of runners, who have learned the knack
of running at *precisely* the same speed. We also have some checksum runners
and backup runners to help correct for errors. The system's all very interesting,
at least to me. I'd explain the details, but I wouldn't want to bore people;

As for why I'm the one pushing the clock? It's nothing special. We chose
randomly. I was the one picked.

Sometimes, I wonder what we'll do, or if we made the right call. It's not my
place to judge. Besides, we'll find out soon.

Right on cue, a runner walks into the room, moving forward at a steady pace.

"It's time."

I nod, and start pushing the second hand forward. It starts to
shift with a loud, creaking sound, a sound far too loud for what should be
an ordinary clock. I push, and push, and push - and then it's free.

*Tick.*

*Tock.*

*Tick.*

*Tock.*

*Tick.*

Sometime in early July, I thought of the beginning and end of this story.
I liked the idea, I knew what notes I wanted to hit, and I had ideas about
how to write it. Best of all, it was an idea that worked best as a short story,
which made it excellent practice.

I started a draft before ICML, and then forgot about it for several weeks,
since I was too busy with conferences and travel.

By the time I revisited it, I had finished reading <em>American Gods</em>, and it almost
convinced me to throw the story away. The storytelling in that book
was so lyrical that it made mine feel like a tragedy. I then decided it would
be okay if my story was worse than American Gods, because a lot of things are
worse than American Gods. I needed to write this story, and so I did.
Know that I did my best to steal the parts of <em>American Gods</em>'s writing that I
liked the most.

The bulk of this story was written while listening to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3sm6RcBpXU">Demetori's rendition of Eastern Dream</a>
on repeat. This has nothing to do with anything. I just like that song very much.
