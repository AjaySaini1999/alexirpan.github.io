Everyone knew when time froze, and no one knew when it would start again.

It was strange, really. Cars paused in the road, puffs of smoke stuck
to their tailpipes like cotton candy. Raindrops and snowflakes hung in the air,
casting fixed shadows on sidewalks and fields around the world. Planes hung
in the sky, forming the world's largest crib mobile.

Stranger still was what wasn't affected: people. Only people. It was as if
time freezing was not enough - there needed to witnesses to the strangeness,
and those witnesses needed to be human.

First there was panic, then there was confusion, and then there were questions,
and at that point the chain stopped, because answers weren't coming as quickly
as people liked.

Almost everyone's first reaction was to reach for their smartphone, but it
turned out smartphones don't do very much if time isn't working. Computers
didn't do much either. Trains needed the movement of steam, cars needed the
controlled explosions of combusion engines, and landlines needed the flow of
electricity. Communication had regressed to ancient times. It was a moment of
great stress, that strecthed out into eternity.

The President of the United States had a problem. He needed to give a speech to
the public. But how do you do so when nothing works?

After some discussion, Congress decided to recruit volunteer runners to literally
run around the world, deliver the speech whenever they found people, and to recruit
more messengers to follow their example.

It took about one subjective week to recruit enough people and to get them to
memorize the speech well enough to deliver it. It took a few more for runners to
make it across the continental United States.

By the time the first runner made it to the West Coast, it had been about one
subjective month since The Event, and no one cared very much about what the
President had to say. They had long since decided they were on their own, and
had resolved not to pay too much attention to what happened anyplace else.

All things considered, it could have been worse.

Humans no longer needed to sleep. They didn't need to eat. They didn't need
to drink. They simply *were*. No one got any better, no one got any worse, and
death was no longer a way of life. It wasn't the post-scarcity utopia that
people had dreamed of, but at least everyone had what they needed to live,
even if it was done by driving all required demands to zero.

Without work to drive them, people had a lot of free time. If anything
is unambiguously true, it is that people need to do *something*, and that's
exactly what they did. Some went to math. Others went to philosophy, bringing
several strange yet wonderful ideas. A few oddballs decided to devote their lives
to Chess and Go, some of the few forms of entertainment that weren't impacted
by The Event.

On a whim, a family of four from Montana decides to go storm hunting. They plan a journey to
Southeast Asia, where a great thunderstorm is raging across the sky, flecks
of lightning hanging in the air like stars.

A group of bridemaids from Africa decide to visit America before a wedding. They
stop by a tornado , and visit the center of America. They stop by a tornado and
pose next to the funnel cloud, laughing like chimes in the wind.

An elderly couple from Sao Paulo decide to climb Mount Everest. It wasn't the
most original thing to do, but it's Mount Everest. How are you not supposed to climb
the highest peak in the world?

The world was their oyster, and people realized there were pearls all around
them, even in the little things. They just needed the chance to find them for
themselves.
