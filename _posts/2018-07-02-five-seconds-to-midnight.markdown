Everyone knew when time froze, and no one knew when it would start again.

It was strange, really. Cars paused in the road, puffs of smoke stuck
to their tailpipes like cotton candy. Raindrops and snowflakes hung in the air,
casting fixed shadows on sidewalks and fields around the world. Planes hung
in the sky, forming the world's largest crib mobile.

Stranger still was what wasn't affected: people. Only people. It was as if
time freezing was not enough - there needed to witnesses to the strangeness,
and those witnesses needed to be human.

First there was panic, then there was confusion, and then there were questions,
and at that point the chain stopped, because answers weren't coming as quickly
as people liked.

Almost everyone's first reaction was to reach for their smartphone, but it
turned out smartphones don't do very much if time isn't working. Computers
didn't do much either. Trains needed the movement of steam, cars needed the
controlled explosions of combusion engines, and landlines needed the flow of
electricity. Communication had regressed to ancient times. It was a time of great
stress, and like everything else, it never changed. It would never change.

For a while, each city was its own oasis, until messengers managed to carry
the news on foot.

World leaders tried to assure their constituents, but it was difficult to

messages on foot, but a person can only travel so far every day.

After about a week, it became clear that it wasn't the end times, and
