I've been working on my current research project for around four to six months.
The results haven't been that good. I have a meeting about it tomorrow, and
I'd say there's about a 50-50 chance we decide I should stop working on the
project and switch to another one. If it ends that way, well, that sucks.
But after reflecting on it for a while, I think I'm mentally prepared for
that outcome.

In preparation for that meeting, my manager recommended I write a document
describing what the project is, how it got to where it is now, and all the
things I tried along the way. I agreed this was a good idea, although I
was starting to get sick of explaining my project. In the past,
I wrote a doc when I proposed the project, then made a presentation after
it got refined, then wrote another doc when I pivoted. Ironically,
all that documentation made it hard to figure out where the project was,
because each doc built on the previous ones.

From a naive viewpoint, writing a summary shouldn't have taken that long.
I've been living and breathing this project
for months, and I had already written several documents on the project. How
long could writing one more take?

Well, turns out it took me about a day. That's actually not too long, all
things considered, but why did it have to take that long at all? It was only
summarizing things I'd already written.

The tricky part of research is that the author is trying to take these
grand ideas, that have never been arranged the way the author's arranged them,
and then he or she needs to convert them into text that gets the point across.

Yasha Berchenko-Kogan (who I actually kinda know in real life) has a great quote
about [communicating research](https://gist.github.com/stoutbeard/4158578).

> Communicating these ideas is a bit like trying to explain a vacuum cleaner to someone who has never seen one, except you're only allowed to use words that are four letters long or shorter.

A lot of the metaphorical four letter words I used weren't useful anymore, and
filtering it into just the key points was most of the work.

When I got comments back, I had a shocking revelation: **the only one who fully
understood my project was me.**

On the surface, that's not so surprising, so let me clarify. I've been talking
to most of these people about my project for months. They've received and read
every doc I wrote about my project, from start to finish. I've had one-on-ones
with several of them to explain the issues I've run into.

*And I was the only one who understood everything that was going on?*

**_What the hell?_**

I used to think good writing was important because nobody wants to extend research
that's hard to understand.

But now I've realized there's another big benefit. If you want people to give
useful feedback, it's very important they understand the problem as well as you
do.

I'm about to describe one of those ideas that's obviously true, but maybe you
haven't seen it before. Are you ready? Okay, good.

When people say "That sounds good to me", they're implicitly saying "Based on
my understanding of the problem, that sounds good to me." Worryingly, if you
describe only the high level idea, their brains will fill in the details
of those ideas by themselves. And the details they fill in *will be ones that
make sense to them*, **which likely differ from the details you're actually
thinking of.**

The relevant point: **if you ask for help from your advisor, they're going to
give you advice based on how they understand your problem, and if your real
problem is in one of the details they've glossed over in their understanding
of the problem, you're not going to get good advice.**

If you yourself are a researcher, and this was a new idea for you, read over
it a few times. It may not directly apply to your situation, but flavors of it
should be applicable.

In hindsight, the biggest pivots in my research happened when experienced
researchers finally grasped a detail I thought they'd already understood.
They would then immediately make an obvious argument for why doing it that
way was dumb, and then I'd feel like an idiot.

If everyone's busy trying to climb your chain of reasoning, they might not
notice the weak links, because they're busy climbing, and may assume
you've already made sure all the links make sense.

The disappointing thing here is that if I had explained my research project
better, I could have saved a few weeks of work, because I wouldn't have done
many of the things I did do.

Research miscommunication is inevitable. It takes a long time to explain things
properly, and usually people don't have the time for that. I suspect that's the
main reason research takes so long - it's the blind leading the blind.
Sometimes the blind one is you. Sometimes it's someone else.
And it's hard to tell the difference.

Really, the best we can do is minimize the costs. Prefer simple ideas. They're
easier to explain, which makes getting feedback easier. Try to talk to
people outside your collaboration group, to make sure the foundations make
sense. Remember to review things within your collaboration group, to make sure
people understand why things are the way they are. Revisit the assumptions
you made at the start of the project, and make sure those assumptions still
make sense.

If the pattern holds, people aren't going to understand everything I wanted
them to understand from this post. Oh well. I tried.
