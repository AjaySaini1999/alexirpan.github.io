Turns out the secret to getting more blog posts out of me is to
*royally piss me off*.

There'a [a viral video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFxFRqNmXKg)
claiming Google manipulated search results in favor of Hillary.
I've seen several people watch this and say, "Yeah, seems likely."
In contrast, my reaction was to laugh at the video, and I did,
before I found out how many people believed it. Then I was just mad.

I may regret this, but here's why I find the whole affair preposterous.


The Argument
--------------------------------------------------------

While researching for a report about the last presidential primaries,
SourceFed found that Google's autocomplete suggestions for search queries
involving Hillary differed from Yahoo's and Bing's. Google's autocompletes
were both more positive and less common than Yahoo's and Bing's suggestions.
In contrast, a few autocompletes tried for Sanders and Trump matched
across all search engines.

They then examine the relationship between Hillary and Eric
Schmidt, to give Google a motive for biasing search results.


My Rebuttal
-----------------------------------------------------------

Autocompletes are Not Biased Just for Hillary
==========================================================

![Other search results](/public/hillary-google/searches.jpg)
{: .centered }

These are results found by [Snopes](http://www.snopes.com/google-manipulate-hillary-clinton/).
They have similar results for Trump. So, right off the bat it seems like the
video didn't try enough search queries.

When there is more uncertainty in what
search the user is making, Google biases towards a more positive result.
This is something that happens whenever the search includes anyone's name. It
hold for Sanders, and for Trump, and for Hillary, with no preference to any
of them. See Google's explanation [here](https://search.googleblog.com/2016/06/google-search-autocomplete.html).

Note this is **not** the same as Google always having positive search
results. If someone searches "Bernie Sanders so", it's likely it will
get completed to "Bernie Sanders socialist", since Sanders self-identifies
as a democratic socialist. On the other hand, he does not identify as
communist, making "Bernie Sanders communist" a rarer phrase. That's
why Google autocompletes "socialist" but not "communist".

The only interesting thing here is that "socialist" has better sentiment
than "communist", and that it isn't seen as an offensive enough word to avoid.


It Would Be Too Difficult to Hide The Conspiracy
============================================================

Let's set aside motive. Because actually, I don't give a shit about the motive.
I don't care how Hillary and Eric Schmidt are related. A good motive increases
the likelihood a person does something, but it doesn't magically make that
something happen.

So to play devil's advocate, let's ignore motive, and assume Google has
been manipulating search results for Hillary. In such a world,
what also has to be true?

Code acting specifically for Hillary had to be added in by a programmer.
That code then made it past code review. No one on the entire search
team noticed this, or anyone who did decided to stay quiet.
Let's say the team is on the order of 100 engineers. Search is a core product
of Google and the company is over 50,000 employees, so I think this is a close
enough guess.

This is a lot of people! And nobody acted as a whistleblower?
Note that [Sanders outraised Clinton in Silicon Valley](https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolineodonovan/bernie-sanders-is-still-outraising-hillary-clinton-among-tec?utm_term=.cb1V3oKlO#.xyDM6akXw),
so there must be a sizable contingent of Sanders fans, who would certainly
report this if it actually existed.

**If the conspiracy is true, then
none of those 100 engineers reported it, despite having direct access
to Google's codebase. And, despite a sizable fraction of them being
Bernie supporters. AND, despite them knowing search very well because
_it is their literal full-time job._**

This is incredibly preposterous.
I've read many arguments for *why* Google would bias
their autocomplete results, but I've yet to see anyone explain
*how* a company could hide a conspiracy to influence the presidential election.
Scandals are really, really hard to
cover up - think of how many government scandals the public finds out about.


The Part Where I Go Off The Rails and Rant and Maybe Piss People Off
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I could stop this post here, because all I needed to do was cast reasonable
doubt on this video. But just for kicks, let me explain *why* I got trolled
into writing this post.

SourceFed claims the conspiracy was so subtle that they only realized it
after all the presidential primaries ended. Why? Why now, instead of after
other big election days? It could be random chance, but I have another
explanation.

Here's my claim: while Bernie had a chance at becoming the nominee, people
focused on ways Bernie could win. Once Bernie lost in California,
instead of grieving in
silence, they turned to finding reasons Bernie *deserved* to win.
Because that's how the narrative goes! The system is corrupt, it's fighting
against the One True Candidate at every turn. It doesn't even have to be
a conscious decision, a subconscious bias towards believing Bernie was cheated
makes people susceptible to ballooning a small difference in autocomplete
results into the extraordinary claim that Google is in cahoots with Hillary.
They didn't ask if their evidence was strong enough to back their claim,
because it fit the storyline.

This is symptomatic of a trend I've noticed among the most intolerable Bernie
supporters. I am *not* talking about the Bernie supporters who like his
policies and really wanted him to win the nomination. The majority of Bernie
supporters I interact with are reasonable people who don't let their love
for Bernie blind themselves from the realities of the situation.

No, I'm talking about the die hard fans. The ones who have deified Bernie
practically to the level of the Second Coming. Here comes Bernie Sanders,
our Lord and Savior, descending from the mountaintops of Vermont! Wielding
pen and paper, he'll fight the establishment at every turn! Where
establishment = exactly every part of politics working against Bernie Sanders.

To these people, the idea that Hillary won because a large percentage of
voters agreed with her platform is ridiculous. Instead, they'd prefer to
believe Hillary bought all her votes, as if everyone who voted for her was
a mindless drone or sheep.
Because she's establishment, and establishment is evil.
Establishment is the bane of our existence. They are the Enemy, they hold all
the keys. Whoever the establishment backs wins, which is why the two
nominees are Hillary Clinton and Jeb
Bush. YEP. THAT IS DEFINITELY WHAT HAPPENED.

Believing the system is corrupt is fine. Wanting to decrease money's
influence in politics is an admirable goal. Voting for a candidate you
believe in is the whole point of democracy. And grieving when a candidate
loses just shows how much you cared about electing the person you believed
would make the world a better place.

But if you're going to revel in tribalism, if you're going to
shift the boundaries whenever it lets
you avoid getting mad about something you like, or if you're going to decide
someone's intelligence based on which candidate they like, I will find it
very hard to respect you. I will find it very hard to tolerate you.
If you refuse to be civil in debates, I will ignore you.

In contrast, if you understand that people are messy, political beliefs are
a maze of dead ends, and arguments where people respect each other are
doable, then holy shit, *we should keep in touch*.

If you can't do that? Well, then no. We shouldn't keep in touch. It's not worth my time,
and you'll find plenty of people to get mad at instead of me.

Oh, and if you make a conspiracy video with horrible justification, I'll feel
free to laugh at you. It's not nice, in fact it's downright mean, but I find it
a hell of a lot easier than thinking about a world where people will believe
something because an eight minute video pandered to them in the right way.
