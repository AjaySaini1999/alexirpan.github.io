*Written quickly. Close to stream-of-consciousness.*

If you haven't kept up with recent news in the intersection between academia and
politics, here is the short version: the currently debated GOP tax bill
significantly increases the tax burden on graduate students, and it just
passed the House.

This has been covered by [Scott Aaronson](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3542),
[Luca Trevisan](https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2017/11/07/against-a-61-tax-increase-on-berkeley-students/),
and others. The below is mostly summary
of information from there. Skip to the next section if you'd just like my
opinion.

Currently, university's handle PhD student tuition like this.

* The graduate student pays $$\$X$$ as tuition.
* The university waives $$\$X$$ of the tuition.
* The university then pays a graduate student stipend of $$\$S$$.
* In the current system, stipend $$\$S$$ is taxed and the waived tuition $$\$X$$
is not. The student only ever receives $$\$S$$ - the $$\$X$$ is essentially
invisible.

Under the new GOP tax bill, the waived tuition $$\$X$$ will be taxed. This is
a double whammy, since not only does it increase the total amount of taxable
income, the increase is enough to push several students into the next federal
tax bracket. A more detailed breakdown can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e3oIk8AO9F_UL98z5cieKha1V5e9azzB/view).
The linked analysis shows that if nothing else changes,
a typical in-state Berkeley PhD student would pay about $1400 more
tax, and a typical MIT PhD student would pay about $9500 more tax. These are
rough orders of magnitude for how it affects public universities vs private
universities, with more damage to private universities because they have
a higher tuition. **Importantly, students would not get taxed because of
a larger stipend - they would be taxed on money that has never entered their
pockets in the first place.**

As for why universities can't simply declare that grad student tuitions
are $$\$0$$ - there's some accounting trick that lets the university get more
money if they give tuition waivers to grad students. I haven't looked into the
details of this.

I'm currently not in academia, for several reasons, but the big one is that
I got a job offer from an industry research lab with interests close
to mine. I'm certainly giving up some things, but the trade-offs
fall in favor of me staying out of academia.

If I had gone to academia, I would have been okay financially,
thanks to several lucky breaks. I was born in an upper-middle class
family, the kind that doesn't spend a lot of money but has money to burn.
I had natural interest in math and computer science, and turns out
the world's willing to pay those people quite a bit if they enter finance
or software. I liked algorithms, which
happened to be the weird test of software engineering prowess in
Silicon Valley - the only reason I got my first internship was because I knew
the pseudocode for Dijkstra's algorithm.
And although part of my heart will always
belong to the beauty of proofs, I tolerated systems enough to pick up the
skills that let me handle industry.

Overall, I've lived a privileged life. That likely wouldn't
change in academia because CS PhDs have it easier than other departments.
With careful spending, I think I could intern at
a tech company some months of the year, use the money from that to fund
research for the rest of the year, and still end net positive.

The thing is, these policies aren't crippling to people like me. They're
crippling to the less fortunate.

I can't speak for other fields, but academia for CS is increasingly a rich
person's game. Any strong PhD candidate could be at least an average software
engineer, and that's a lot of money to leave off the table. I've read an
anecdotal story of a promising research, first to go to college in her family,
and she laughed at the thought of going for a PhD. Her parents had done
so much to support her. It would have been too selfish to turn
down a well-paying job that could let her start paying them back.

**Across all fields, the tax bill would essentially do the same: make
academia more of a rich person's game.** The reason the news bothers me so much is
that if it goes through, there's going to be so much unfulfilled passion,
so many students who can't let their research interests override
financial realities. It's a duller, less colorful world.

To play devil's advocate, the analysis above assumes
nothing else about the world will change. This is very unrealistic.
If the tax bill goes through as is, universities will certainly
adjust - ask for more donations, decrease tuition, and make up the accounting
shortfall elsewhere with even more creative costcutting. The
actual tax increase would likely be lower than the current numbers.

However, I have a hard time believing that universities will be able to
make up all the difference. Universities certainly have bloat, and a reduced
budget provides a very strong motivation to identify that bloat - but based
on what I've heard about university financials, I'm not convinced there's
a lot that can be cut without a fight.
There are some damning numbers showing that administrators are taking up an
[increasingly large share of university budgets](http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-berkeley-deficit-20160421-story.html),
but I'd guess that you can't just layoff a ton of admins and expect the
university to put itself back together in a reasonable timeframe.

The top-tier universities can weather this better. The lower-tier
universities, less so. It's the same rich person's game - universities that
already have trouble with recruiting grad students will have even more
trouble recruiting grad students. The conclusion is similarly
disappointing.

Throughout this post, I've been assuming academia is intrinsically valuable.
That's certainly up for debate. One argument I've seen is
that outside of the top-tier universities, academia is a net-negative
pursuit, and it would be better for society if lower-tier schools were
priced out of relevance. Given the latent misery and stress
of academia, and the constant self-doubt researchers have about the relevance
of their own work, I think it's worth considering this argument seriously.
However, debating the merits of academia is out of the scope of this post.

To funnel everything back into RL terms (since I'm "that RL guy") - I see
academia as the ultimate extreme of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.
Industry is content to do what works, industry research labs can be more
exploratory, and academia gets to consider crazy ideas that may not be
relevant for decades. In my ideal society, there are always people taking
crazy ideas seriously. And I mean that in a good way! Some nuts talking about
water memory, some other people trying to quantify the odds we're living
in a simulation, a third group advocating that we spend the next 50 years
building a model of all of ethics. The strength of academia (and the argument
for tenure) is that it *lets you do these things if you care about them
enough.*

Somewhere out in the world is a cohort of Medieval Studies PhDs, and
I feel very safe saying that little of note will come from there in the
next 25 years. *But that doesn't mean I want them to disappear.* Do you
know how insane you have to be to want to do Medieval Studies? Like,
*holy shit*, you really really really *really* have to like the subject
to want to spend your life doing that. **How is that not crazy awesome?**

The world should have room for people like that. I'm worried it won't.
