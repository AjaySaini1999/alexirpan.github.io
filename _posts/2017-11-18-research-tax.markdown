*Written quickly. Basically stream-of-consciousness.*

If you haven't kept up with recent news in the intersection between academia and
politics, here is the short version: the currently debated GOP tax bill
significantly increases the tax burden on graduate students.

This has been covered in several places (LINK), and the below is mostly summary
of information from there. Skip to the next section if you'd just like my
opinion.

Currently, university's handle PhD student tuition like this.

* The graduate student pays $$\$X$$ as tuition.
* The university waives $$\$X$$ of the tuition.
* The university then pays a graduent student stipend of $$\$S$$.
* In the current system, stipend $$\$S$$ is taxed and the waived tuition $$\$X$$
is not. The student only ever receives $$\$S$$ - the $$\$X$$ is essentially
invisible.

Under the new GOP tax bill, the waived tuition $$\$X$$ will be taxed. This is
a double whammy, since not only does it increase the total amount of taxable
income, the increase is enough to push several students into the next federal
tax bracket. A more detailed breakdown can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e3oIk8AO9F_UL98z5cieKha1V5e9azzB/view).
The linked analysis shows that if nothing else changes,
a typical in-state Berkeley PhD student would pay about $1400 more
tax, and a typical MIT PhD student would pay about $9500 more tax. These are
rough orders of magnitude for how it affects public universities vs private
universities, with more damage to private universities because they have
a higher tuition. **Importantly, students would not get taxed because of
a larger stipend - they would be taxed on money that has never entered their
pockets in the first place.**

As for why universities can't simply declare that grad student tuitions
are $$\$0$$ - there's some accounting that lets the university net more
money if they give tuition waivers to grad students. I haven't looked into the
details of this.

I'm currently not in academia, for several reasons, but the big one is that
my research interests are close to the ones that industry is willing to pay
me for, and although I'm certainly giving up some things, the trade-offs
fall in favor of me staying out of academia.

However, if I had gone to academia, I would have been okay financially,
thanks to several lucky breaks. I was born in an upper-middle class
family, the kind that doesn't spend a lot of money but has money to burn.
I had natural interest in math and computer science, and the world's willing
to pay quite a bit for those kinds of people. I liked algorithms, which
happened to be the weirdly common test of software engineering prowess in
Silicon Valley - the only reason I got my first internship was because I knew
the pseudocode for Dijkstra's algorithm.
And at the same time, although part of my heart will always
belong to the beauty of proofs, I liked parts of systems enough to get
begrudging okay at it, which has served me well in industry.

Overall, I've lived a priviledged life, and that likely wouldn't
change in academia - with careful spending I could actually intern at
a tech company some months of the year, use the money from that to fund the
rest of my research, and I'd still be net positive on my bank account.

The thing is, these policies aren't crippling to people like me. They're
crippling to the people with less fortune.

I can't speak for other fields, but academia for CS is increasingly a rich
person's game. Any strong PhD candidate could be at least an average software
engineer, and that's a lot of money to leave off the table. I've read and
anecdotal story of a promising research, first to go to college in her family,
and she laughed at the thought of going for a PhD. Her parents had done
so much to support her that it would have been incrdibly selfish to turn
down a well-paying job that could let her start paying them back.

Across all fields, this would essentially do the same: make academia even
more of a rich person's game. The reason the news hits me so hard is
that if it goes through, there's going to be so much unfulfilled passion,
so many students who can't let their research interests override their
financial realities, and it feels like a duller, less colorful world.

To play devil's advocate, the analysis above assumes
nothing else about the world will change. This is very unrealistic.
If the tax bill goes through as is, universities will certainly
adjust - ask for more donations, decrease tuition and make up the accounting
shortfall elsewhere with even more creative costcutting, and so on. The
actual tax increase would likely be lower than the current numbers.

However, I have a hard time believing that universities will be able to
make up all the difference. Universities certainly have bloat, and a reduced
budget provides a very strong motivation to identify that bloat - but based
on what I've heard about university financials, I'm not convinced there's
a lot that can easily be cut. There are some damning numbers showing
that administrators are taking up an increasingly large share of
university budgets, but I'd guess that you can't just layoff a ton of
admins and expect the university to put itself back together in a reasonable
timeframe.

The top-tier universities can weather this better. The lower-tier
universities, less so. It's the same rich person's game - universities that
already have trouble with recruiting grad students will have even more
trouble recruiting grad students. And I find the conclusion similarly
disappointing.

Throughout this post, it was hopefully obvious that I see intrinsic
value in academia. That's certainly up for debate. One argument I've seen is
that outside of the top-tier universities, academia is a net-negative
pursuit, and it would be better for society if lower-tier schools were
priced out of relevance. Given the latent misery and stress
of academia, and the constant self-doubt researchers have about the relevance
of their own work, I think it's worth considering this argument seriously.
However, debating the merits of academia is out of the scope of this post.

To funnel everything back into RL terms (since I'm "that RL guy") - I see
academia as the ultimate extreme of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.
Industry is content to do what works, industry research labs can be more
exploratory, and academia gets to consider crazy ideas that may not be
relevant for decades. In my ideal society, there are always people taking
crazy ideas seriously. And I mean that in a good way! Some nuts talking about
water memory, some other people trying to quantify the odds we're living
in a simulation, a third group advocating that we spend the next 50 years
building a model of all of ethics. The strength of academia (and the argument
for tenure) is that it *lets you do these things if you care about them
enough*.

Somewhere out in the world is a small cohort of Medieval Studies PhDs, and
I feel very safe saying that nothing of note will come from there in the
next 25 years. *But that doesn't mean I want them to disappear.* Do you
know how insane you have to be to want to do Medieval Studies? Like,
*holy shit*, you really really really *really* have to like the subject
to want to spend your life doing that, and how is that not crazy awesome?

The world should have room for people like that. I'm worried it won't.
