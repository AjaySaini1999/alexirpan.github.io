While finding ways to spend time that didn't involve studying for an entrance exam,
an out of context quote popped into my head.

> I also believe that the usefulness of software tools is usually greatly underrated. Better tools can act as a significant multiplier on everyoneâ€™s productivity, and the right tools can make it easier for researchers to share code with each other.

(From the announcment for the [Computation Graph Toolkit](http://joschu.github.io/index.html#Announcing%20CGT).
Based on [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/), it's a cool library that
makes it easy to implement neural nets. It's also written by a PhD student I actually
know. Check it out!)

This came after I'd done the bare minimum to organize my life.
I cleared out my inboxes across three email accounts. I set up email forwarding
to send everything to one master account.
For classes and events this semester,
instead of memorizing the times, I added them to Google Calendar. As a side effect
I can check my calendar from my phone and get notifications ahead of every event.

Setting this up took me around 1-2 hours, and it's saved me so much more in just
a few weeks. The real reward, however, has been the peace of mind.
When my inbox has a message,
there's something I need to check. When I need to know when I'll be busy, I can
check my Google Calendar from my phone, so I don't need to remember everything
off the top of my head.

These are all simple, obvious ideas, and I'm incredibly
disappointed I haven't done any of this sooner. Back when I was working on
college applications, I based one essay around my ability to improvise and
have as loose of a plan as possible, since I believed no plan survived contact with
the real world.

Sure, that can be true. Uncertainty is the whole reason [agile development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)
has taken software companies by storm. But my god, I was so, so stupid. It's a cute
saying, to say that it's pointless to plan when your plan will become useless, but
in reality that means *you made a bad plan in the first place*. The plan should
be made in detail according to how likely it is that it'll be ruined. It still makes
sense to talk about where a company is going in 3 months, or the goals a project
should acheive. "No plan survives the real world" doesn't mean "Don't plan at all",
it means "plan broad strokes, come up with some starting points, and expect those
starting points to change along the way."

I'm convinced that I wrote my essay that way because I was too lazy to organize my
life and needed a way to justify it. But there's no justification for bad
organiziation. I cannot think of a single scenario where I can plausibly say
it is better to be unorganized, since organization is a meta skill that applies to
literally everything. It means knowing where to look when you need something,
having a system for note taking that is conducive to learning, never forgetting about
an appointment.

Although there are obviously other factors, the organized, well-regimented people
are the ones who are going to make the biggest impact in the world. And I'm not
one of them.

I need to start improving my process.
