About two weeks ago, I observed on Facebook that reinforcement learning doesn't
actually work, and then claimed that if you think RL can solve your problem,
there's about a 70% chance you're wrong.

On reflection, this pessimism is actually very central to my research frame.
If you're the kind of person who likes talking about AI timelines, it's also
why my timelines are so pessimistic. I think much of the recent hype for
reinforcement learning is deserved, simply because of its potential, but
at the same time it feels very overblown.


Reasons Why Reinforcement Learning Is Hard
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. It Can Be Horribly, Horribly Unstable.

This is the big one, and I feel it's underappreciated by people who haven't
implemented reinforcement learning themselves.

Almost all machine learning algorithms have *hyperparameters*, which influence
the behavior of the learning system. Often these are picked by hand, or tuned
automatically by some hyperparameter optimization algorithm.

In many supervised learning problems, even if you don't do a lot of
hyperparameter tuning, you'll still get reasonable performance. Your accuracy
will increase over time, and
