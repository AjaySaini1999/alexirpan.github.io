Sorta Insightful turns one year old today. To whatever meager readership I have:
thanks. It means more than you'd think.

It's been six months since I wrote my [last retrospective post]({% post_url 2016-02-20-half-year %}).
Let's see what changeed.

\*\*\*
{: .centered }

First off, I owe people an apology. Six months ago, I said the following.

> I plan to start flushing my queue of non-technical post ideas. On the short list are
>
> * A post about *Gunnerkrigg Court*
> * A post on effort icebergs and criticism
> * A post about obsessive fandoms
> * A post detailing the hilariously incompetent history of the Dominion Online implementation

I haven't written any of those posts, and I feel awful for it. I feel especially
bad about the *Gunnerkrigg Court* post, because I've wanted to write a post
about it ever since I started this blog, and I haven't even started a draft yet.
Meanwhile, it's been so long since I started thinking about effort icebergs that
I've forgotten what I actually wanted to say. The closest I can remember
is the tension between criticizing something that somebody put their sweat and
tears into, even if it's terrible? Man, I had that post planned out, and then
never got around to making it.

Similarly, the post on obsessive fandoms never materialized. Last I remember, I
was going to frame it around *My Little POny*, or *Touhou*, or *Homestuck*, or
possibly all three. As for the post about Dominion Online, I at least have a
draft, which I haven't touched since...March 27, 2016. So, about 4.5 months.

All these posts I'd like to write, and they're chained to the ground, not
because I can't write them, but because I'm too lazy to write them.
