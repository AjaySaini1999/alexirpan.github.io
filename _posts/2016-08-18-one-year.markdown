Sorta Insightful turns one year old today. To whatever meager readership I have:
thanks. It means more than you'd think.

It's been six months since I wrote my [last retrospective post]({% post_url 2016-02-20-half-year %}).
Let's see what changeed.

First off, I owe people an apology. Six months ago, I said the following.

> I plan to start flushing my queue of non-technical post ideas. On the short list are
>
> * A post about *Gunnerkrigg Court*
> * A post on effort icebergs and criticism
> * A post about obsessive fandoms
> * A post detailing the hilariously incompetent history of the Dominion Online implementation

I haven't written any of those posts, and I feel awful for it. I feel especially
bad about the *Gunnerkrigg Court* post, because I've wanted to write a post
about it ever since I started this blog, and I haven't even started a draft yet.
Meanwhile, it's been so long since I started thinking about effort icebergs that
I've forgotten what I actually wanted to say. The closest I can remember
is the tension between criticizing something that somebody put their sweat and
tears into, even if it's terrible? Man, I had that post planned out, and then
never got around to making it.

Similarly, the post on obsessive fandoms never materialized. Last I remember, I
was going to frame it around *My Little POny*, or *Touhou*, or *Homestuck*, or
possibly all three. As for the post about Dominion Online, I at least have a
draft, which I haven't touched since...March 27, 2016. So, about 4.5 months.

All these posts that want to be free, and they're chained to the ground, not
because I can't write them, but because I'm too lazy to write them.

Yes, I know that there aren't really people who don't like me because I haven't
written these posts, but this is one of those things where it only matters if I
make it up to myself. I'll try to get one of those posts done as soon as I can.

Next, the neutral news. My blog still doesn't get much traffic outside of my
circle of Facebook friends. I didn't expect it to. One year isn't that long to
build a readership, if you think about it, and I didn't go into this to
try to become popular.

Yes, in theory I could be promoting my blog more, but because my posts are so
unfocused, I don't have one place to promote my posts to. If they were all about
machine learning, maybe I'd be sharing them to Hacker News or r/MachineLearning,
but I never wanted my blog to be only technical or only non-technical.
Somehow, trying to market my blog aggresively doesn't sit well with me. I'll
market my skills when I'm job hunting, but that's a different situation. It
feels like my blog is personal, its own pocket of thoughts that happens to be on
the Internet. Trying to sell out something like that feels awful. I'd like the
approval that popularity gives, but I don't need it.

On to more positive news. Six months ago, I noticed I wrote about one post
every two weeks. How did I do in the six months after that?

Let's ignore May's blogging gauntlet for now. Counting this post, I've written
eight blog posts. In my first six months, I wrote 15 blog posts. So, I've
improved my output, as long as the 31 shorter posts I did in May count as
at least 7 "regular" posts. I'd say they do.

Speaking of which, the blogging gauntlet went really well. The May 31 post
summarizes it pretty well, so I'll let that speak for itself.

I'm getting a lot of really weird feelings when I read through my archive.
I *remember* these posts. That doesn't mean I remember writing them, it means I
remember the context surrounding them. The weekend I cooped myself in my room
and had Mealsquares for lunch. The post I wrote in a night, when I was cashing
in on the AlphaGo hype.

They're not just words. They're *my* words. It's a huge nostalgia trip, to look
back on what I was thought about and realize how I've changed over a year. I'm
definitely not the person I was a year ago.

Upcoming Posts
==============================================================================

In the very, very near future, I'd like to write a post about my position on
the existential risk of AI. For a long time, I had a bunch of conflicting
feelings about it, but going to EA Global forced me to work through some of the
bigger contradictions, and I think I'm ready to explain my thoughts.

I written the start of a really, really stupid short story about
dinosaurs. In the right hands, this story could be pretty neat, but my hands aren't
the right hands. At the same time, it's not going to get better unless I try.
That story may not ever see the light of day, but hopefully it will.

The post about *Gunnerkrigg Court* is going to happen. I swear it will. Just,
not anytime soon. There are a few things I need to write first. I want to get
back into writing longer, well-polished posts. Not a lot of them, just one or
two, to remind myself I can do so.
