I'm writing this from the Boston Logan airport, where a bunch of flights were
cancelled or delayed. Luckily, mine was just delayed, so I only have to wait an
extra 2.5 hours.

I hunted with teammate this year. It's an offshoot of (planes) Galactic
Trendsetters (planes). Galactic was an amalgam of Floor Pi residents, CMU
puzzlers, Berkeley puzzlers, and other connections branching from there.
teammate is primarily the CMU and Berkeley block, plus some other connections.
When deciding which team to join, I picked teammate in part because I expected
it to be a more serious, smaller team. We ended up similar in size to Galactic.

Normally, if multiple teams finish Mystery Hunt, Galactic is one of those teams,
and since teammate was of similar size and composition to Galactic, I expected
the same this year. We didn't get to do the runaround this year because HQ
closed right after the coin was found. If HQ stayed open for longer, we had a
good shot of finishing the Hunt, and although I was disappointed at the
time, I'm okay with it now. Setec is not the largest team. Logistically, it's
a lot of work to run HQ, and they predicted to stop running HQ by Sunday 5pm.

Excluding that we didn't get to do the runaround, this was a very solid Mystery
Hunt. I do feel that a lot of puzzles had more grunt work than previous years,
although I haven't run the math on this. My guess is that Setec overcorrected
from their short 2017 Hunt. I think it's good to have puzzles like this, but it
can be annoying when a lot are like this.

(Puzzle spoilers begin from here.)

The puzzle-solving story starts several weeks before Mystery Hunt, with
Alex Rosenthal's TED talk.

(EMBED?)

We knew that Setec embedded puzzle data in a TED talk in their last Hunt. The
bottom of each slide is Morse code for a nine letter word, where the diagonal
spells INNOVATED. It quickly became a team meme that we should call-in INNOVATED
for the first puzzle in the Hunt, and that we should get started on solving
the meta INNOVATED fed into. We got as far as "inNOVated, it's a meta where you
extract months", before deciding to stop doing stupid things.

I spent the day before Hunt playing Two Rooms and a Boom with people from
Galactic. It's a social deduction game where the biggest gimmick is that you
literally separate people into two rooms. The core rules are like this:
There are two teams, Blue Team and Red Team. Blue Team has the President, and
Red Team has the Bomber. Your goal is to have the President and bomb be in the
same room (if Blue) or different room (if Red) by the end of the game. During
the game, players can share (or not share) their roles with other players, and
every so often, each room must choose people to swap with the other room. It
turns into this interesting game of figuring out the web of trust and distrust,
while trying to disguise who you trust, but still maintaining enough control of
the vote to control who is and isn't leaving the room. But this is balanced by
the fact that to get information, you have to reveal information, and the fact
that you need to choose how to ferry information across rooms. It's neat and
I'd recommend it.

Very, very close to kickoff, I learned about the Mystery Hunt Betting Pool for
predicting who would win.
