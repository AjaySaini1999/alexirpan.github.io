title: Stories I Have Read Online, Which You Can Only Read Online, Which You Should Try Reading (Online)

*Last updated November 26, 2015*

I read a lot more web fiction than the average, probably because I have a barely functioning
social life. Almost all stories I've read the past few years were published
online. There's something very addicting about being able to read a story wherever
I have Internet access. With smartphones, that means practically anywhere.

On one hand, I've missed out on very good books that were published
traditionally. On the other hand, I'm slightly more qualified to recommend
stories that people wouldn't normally hear about.

I intend to write more in-depth reviews for some of these recommendations, and will
link those when done.
To stop this page from getting too unwieldly, **every recommendation must either
link to a full blog post review or be at most three sentences long.**

For now, I'm restricting myself to text only content. Anything visual like
webcomics will have to wait for another time.

Stories in each category are ordered roughly by how much I liked them.

# Overall Favorites

*The other stories are good. These are better.*

**Worm**, by Wildbow

Status: Completed

Link: [here](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/about/)

Vivid characters in a slowly evolving world where superpowers are real.
Everything about the world feels organic and realistic. Dark and gritty
with lots of entertaining fights that are won by cleverness instead of
brute strength.

**Fallout Equestria**, by kkat (MLP x Fallout)

Status: Completed

Link: [here](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/119190/fallout-equestria)

Much like Worm, this asks how people (or ponies in this case) act when the
chips are down. Blends MLP and Fallout canon very cleverly, but is good enough
that you should try reading it even if you know nothing about either.
When the author can make a pool of water scarier than a squad of raiders, you
know you have something special.

# Original Work

*You see a blank piece of paper, but I see potential.*

**Pact**, by Wildbow

Status: Completed

Link: [here](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/about/)

Modern supernatural. Workings of the world are explicitly kept vague and
ill-defined, which can be frustrating at times.
Strong start that peters out in the middle, but the final arcs make up for it.


**Twig**, by Wildbow

Status: In Progress (updates 2-3 times a week.)

Link: [here](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/about/)

A biopunk story set in the early 1900s. This is in progress, so the big picture
is still unfolding. So far, everything has been a nice mix of entertainingly awesome
and subtly (or not so subtly) horrifying.


**Ra**, by qntm

Status: Completed

Link: [here](http://qntm.org/ra)

Magic breaks the laws of physics, but it still has to follow the laws of magic.
A hard science fiction story where characters try to discover what magic can
and cannot do. There is no shame in looking up concepts you don't know;
this is a story that cites Godel's Incompleteness Theorems in relevant context.


**Fine Structure**, by qntm

Status: Completed

Link: [here](http://qntm.org/structure)
 
A hard science fiction story told through many perspectives in anachronic order,
eventually converging into a coherent narrative.
The height of my addiction was in my second reading of the story, not the first,
because I knew what was going on the second time through.
The characterization is weak, but this story is carried by its ideas,
not its characters.


**Other Short Stories**, by qntm

# Harry Potter

*Harry - yer a wizard.*

**Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality**, by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Status: Completed

Link: [here](http://hpmor.com/)

Harry Potter grows up in a loving household and spends most of his childhood
reading books about physics, chemistry, cognitive science, probability, etc.
He goes to Hogwarts, and then things get complicated.
This tends to be a love it or hate it story.


**Harry Potter and the Natural 20**, by Sir Poley (Harry Potter x D&D)

Status: Unfinished, assumed dead

Link: [here](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20)

A munchkin from the D&D universe drops into the Harry Potter universe, and abuses
both systems of magic to much hilarity. Starts off funny, then slowly leads to
real character development and drama. For all encounters, the author rolled
dice in real life before deciding what to write next, and Milo actually has
a character sheet (which is unfortunately out of date.)

# My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic

*I felt it the very moment I realized how happy I was to hear you, to see you,
how much I cared about you. The spark ignited inside me when I realized that you all...are my friends!*


**MLP Loops**, by many people (MLP x everything)

Status: Ongoing (updates every few weeks)

Spoils: Up through end of season 3. Writers incorporate new episodes as they
get aired, so the latest chapters spoil up through the latest episode.

Link: [here](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9216685/1/MLP-Loops)

A strangely addictive anthology of short stories where characters are stuck
in Groundhog Day time loops. Starts arbitrary, then build an increasingly
elaborate canon over time. There are other time loop stories for other
fandoms, but the MLP one is the biggest.


**Hard Reset**, by Eakin

Status: Complete

Spoils: Up through end of season 2. Sequels spoil through end of season 3.

Link: [here](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset)

Twilight Sparkle gets stuck in a time loop right before an alien invasion
comes to destroy the city, and she has all of eternity to find out how to
stop it. Think Edge of Tomorrow with more emphasis on the psychological damage
that could happen.
Pretty short with an excellent ending chapter.

Followed by **A Stitch in Time** (romantic comedy with some adventure), then concluded
by **You Can Fight Fate** (adventure).



**Friendship is Optimal**, by Iceman

Status: Complete

Spoils: Nothing. You can actually read this without knowing MLP, since it's
set on Earth.

Link: [here](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal)

Hanna is the CEO of Hofvarpnir Studios, and after the success
of their AI generated shooter The Fall of Asgard, they've been
contacted to make an MMO for My Little Pony.
At its core, this is a story about AI, not about people. It makes it somewhat
alien to read through, but I still liked it.


**Friendship is Optimal: The Law Offices of Artemis, Stella & Beat**, by Eakin

Status: Complete

Spoils: Nothing (except Friendship is Optimal)

Link: [here](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/70441/friendship-is-optimal-the-law-offices-of-artemis-stella-beat)

Fan-fanfiction based on Friendship is Optimal from the
perspective of a lawyer. I liked this over
Friendship is Optimal because it's grounded more in human interaction.
Unfortunately, you do need to read about 2/3rd of Friendship is Optimal to
appreciate this.


**A Taste of The Good Life**, by Eakin

Status: Complete

Spoils: Up through end of season 2

Link: [here](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/134645/a-taste-of-the-good-life)

A romantic slice of life story that stays light throughout.
The plot is predictable from a mile away, but that doesn't make it bad because
the execution is solid.

# Worm

*Doing the wrong things for the right reasons.*

**Cenotaph**, by notes

Status: Completed

Spoilers: Doesn't spoil major plot points, but will spoil some character arcs.

Link: [here](http://archiveofourown.org/works/1152749/chapters/2337442)

An original flavor AU where Taylor decides to take matters into her own hands.
The writing style is concise, and every word feels deliberate.
If you liked Worm, you will almost certainly like Cenotaph.

Followed by **Wake**, then **Legacy**. Wake is completed and Legacy is in progress.

**Manager**, by Seraviel

Status: In Progress. Sporadic updates but may be better to treat as dead.

Spoilers: Will spoil major Worm plot points, read after finishing Worm.

Link: [here](http://archiveofourown.org/works/1536152/chapters/3251618)

An AU where Taylor triggers with a completely broken power, and uses it to
troll the entire setting. At the same time, her power still has limits, which lets
her avoid Mary Sue issues. Lighthearted and all around fun.
