Back in 2008, Randall Munroe, creator of xkcd, put up this comic.

In a perfect storm of bike-shedding, this comic was by far his most
controversial, beating out his endorsement of Obama. It seemed that
everyone had a different opinion about fruit, and wanted him to know.

For a while, I've wanted to know what the average fruit opinion is.
One day, I decided to stop being lazy and actually make a survey.


Survey Design
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Each fruit's ease of eating and tastiness is rated on a scale of 1 to 10,
with 1 the worst and 10 the best. I then shared the survey to a few
places - my Facebook friends, the xkcd subreddit, and the SampleSize
subreddit.

Along the way, I got some comments about my survey design. My population
is biased towards people who frequent these subreddits, and
placing the xkcd comic at the start of the survey biases the results.

PICTURE?

These are both fair criticisms. In my defense, I wanted to give context
for why the survey existed, and it's a survey about fruit.
Literally fruit. It's not supposed to be a big deal.

In total, I got over 1300 responses. Additionally, everyone's fruit opinion
is indeed unique; no two responses had the exact same fruit rating. (To be fair,
it would be more surprising if this weren't true. With over 20 different fruit,
each rated on a scale from 1 to 10, it's incredibly unlikely that two different
people would agree exactly.)


It's Time For...GRAPHS
----------------------------------------------------

I imagine many people won't care, but instead of showing just the final graph,
I'm going to show the iterations I went through.

Here's a first pass, created using Python.

![First graph](/public/fruit-opinion/graph1.png)
{: .centered }

Right away, we can tell fruit are noticeably more cluttered than the original graph.
This happens because even controversial fruit have enough fans to keep the average
from dropping too low. Although grapefruit is one of the least popular fruits by
tastiness, its average taste rating is still at 4.76. Meanwhile, the tastiest fruit,
strawberries, have a taste rating of 8.39. As a whole, people like fruit. In comparison, everyone
agrees it's a pain in the ass to eat pomegranate and pineapple.
This makes the fruit opinions very vertically
compressed.

We can fix this with some vertical stretching. The taste of each fruit is scaled such that
the difference from max taste to min taste equals the difference from max difficulty to
min difficulty, and such that the average taste stays the same.

Much better.
