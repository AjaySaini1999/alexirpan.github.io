Back in 2008, Randall Munroe, creator of xkcd, put up this comic.

PICTURE

In a perfect storm of bike-shedding, this comic was by far his most
controversial, beating out his endorsement of Obama. It seemed that
everyone had a different opinion about fruit, and wanted him to know.

For a while, I've wanted to know what the average fruit opinion is.
One day, I decided to stop being lazy and actually make a survey.


Survey Design
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Each fruit's ease of eating and tastiness is rated on a scale of 1 to 10,
with 1 the worst and 10 the best. I then shared the survey to a few
places - my Facebook friends, the xkcd subreddit, and the SampleSize
subreddit.

Along the way, I got some comments about my survey design. My population
is biased towards people who frequent these subreddits, and
placing the xkcd comic at the start of the survey biases the results.

PICTURE?

These are both fair criticisms. In my defense, I wanted to give context
for why the survey existed, and it's a survey about fruit.
Literally fruit. It's not supposed to be a big deal.

In total, I got over 1300 responses. Additionally, everyone's fruit opinion
is indeed unique; no two responses had the exact same fruit rating.
