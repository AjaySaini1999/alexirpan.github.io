Back in 2008, Randall Munroe, creator of xkcd, put up this comic.

In a perfect storm of bike-shedding, this comic was by far his most
controversial, beating out his endorsement of Obama. It seemed that
everyone had a different opinion about fruit, and wanted him to know.

For a while, I've wanted to know what the average fruit opinion is.
One day, I decided to stop being lazy and actually make a survey.


Survey Design
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Each fruit's ease of eating and tastiness is rated on a scale of 1 to 10,
with 1 the worst and 10 the best. I then shared the survey to a few
places - my Facebook friends, the xkcd subreddit, and the SampleSize
subreddit.

Along the way, I got some comments about my survey design. My population
is biased towards people who frequent these subreddits, and
placing the xkcd comic at the start of the survey biases the results.

PICTURE?

These are both fair criticisms. In my defense, I wanted to give context
for why the survey existed, and it's a survey about fruit.
Literally fruit. It's not supposed to be a big deal.

In total, I got over 1300 responses. Additionally, everyone's fruit opinion
is indeed unique; no two responses had the exact same fruit rating. (To be fair,
it would be more surprising if this weren't true. With over 20 different fruit,
each rated on a scale from 1 to 10, it's incredibly unlikely that two different
people would agree exactly.)


Analysis
----------------------------------------------------

Results
================================================

The five most difficult fruits are

1. Pineapple
2. Pomegranate
3. Honeydew
4. Grapefruit
5. Cantaloupe

Pineapple and pomegranate are the clear losers here. Honeydew, grapefruit, and
cantaloupe are all roughly tied in difficulty.

The five easiest fruits are

1. Seedless Grapes
2. Blueberried
3. Strawberries
4. Bananas
5. Red Apples

No surprises here.

Now, onto taste. The five worst tasting fruits are

1. Lemons
2. Grapefruit
3. Tomatoes
4. Honeydew
5. Cantaloupe

As a fellow grapefruit hater, I approve. As a fan of cantaloupe, I question
people's judgment.

The five best tasting fruits are

1. Strawberries
2. Seedless Grapes
3. Peaches
4. Blueberries
5. Mango

Personally, I'm surprised seedless grapes was 2nd, while seeded grapes
was 13th. It's not a small difference either - here are the two histograms.

Seems like it was hard to disentangle the taste of the fruit
from how annoying eating
the fruit is.

Finally, controversy. I measured this by fitting a normal distribution
to the cloud of replies for each fruit. The distribution is fitted to
difficulty/ease and tastiness simultaneously.
A fruit is controversial if its normal distribution has large variance.

The five least controversial fruits are

1. Strawberries
2. Seedless Grapes
3. Oranges
4. Blueberries
5. Tangerines

By definition, this shouldn't be surprising.

The five most controversial fruits are

1. Tomatoes
2. Grapefruit
3. Mango
4. Watermelon
5. Lemons

Congratulations to mango, for managing to be both controversial and in the
top five tastiest fruits.


Graphs
=============================================================

I had to bend the numbers a little bit here. It turns out the average
tastes for each fruit are a lot closer than their average difficulty.
Stretching the taste-axis exaggerates the relative difference
between fruits without changing their ranking.

Here's the same plot overlaid onto the original comic. It's a bit
cluttered.

Finally, here's the plot with confidence ellipses from the fitted
normal distributions. Don't read too much into the absolute size
of each ellipse. Only a small fraction of response actually lie within
each ellipse, but drawing a 90% confidence ellipse would have made
the ellipses overlap more than they already do. What matters is
the relative size between ellipses.
