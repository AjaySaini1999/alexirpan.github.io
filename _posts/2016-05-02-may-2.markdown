In the past few years, I've learned a very useful trick for pretending to be
wise. When you come across an argument, all you have to do is say something
like this.

> I think boiling this issue down to black and white is an oversimplification.
> There's a lot of ambiguity here. This isn't fiction, where people are
> objectively in the right or wrong, it's reality. It's all full of grey,
> and how grey someone appears is all a matter of perspective.

The beauty of statements like this is that it:

* First identifies a black and white division, which makes it sound like
everyone is on one side or the other.
* Then, proposes such a division is bullshit. Which it is, but the phrasing
makes it sound like that division was there the whole time, when it probably
wasn't.
* Finally, you point out why it's bullshit, and now you're "that guy" who's
floating above the argument.

And the whole time, *I've never stated how I feel about the issue itself.*

Now, I've been trying to cut back on arguments like that, because I want
to get better at actually saying things. But, I'm actually going to use it
a bit to explain why I've been finding it hard to blog.
