Let's talk about work and play.

These are topics that people absolutely love to bring up when talking
about motivation and productivity. Here's how the argument goes.
People who do lots of work do so because they want to. They find ways
to make work fun. The average employee goes to work to earn a paycheck,
then plays elsewhere. Work to live, not live to work. But these people,
these special people can drive enjoyment our of their work. For them,
work is play, work is fun, and that self-satisfication drives them
to produce at incredible rates.

On one hand, I do agree with parts of this. In general, people who
like their job will do more at their job. It's obvious. And then people
who like hobbies will spend time outside of work on those hobbies.
They'll learn how to dance, or maybe play an instrument. Maybe they'll
organize a D&D campaign.

But fundamentally, doing all these things still requires effort.
Learning an instrument well takes focused practice. Running a D&D campaign
requires someone to craft a plausible setting and characters. There is
real effort there, and personally, sometimes I'm too tired to do something
that I get enjoyment out of.

Being a passive consumer of entertainment is almost zero effort for
reasonable gain. Writing a blog post requires me to put in the time to
write. It may be more personally fulfilling, but after a long day it's hard
to convince my brain to put in *more* time.

If there is work and there is play, then for me blogging is a mix between
the two. I want to write more, but there's this pressure to make the words
I'm writing perfect and well-polished. To make every sentence a clean pearl,
saying exactly what I mean in exactly as many words as I need. The issue is that
it takes a long time to write in a polished way, and that makes blogging
too daunting to do in my spare time.

A few weeks ago, I had a conversation with somebody. She said it was nice to
have a low effort writing outlet. That way, she could write whatever she wanted,
without worrying about having to make it perfect.

I feel I could benefit from something similar, and that's part of why
I did this challenge. By forcing myself to write 500 words every day, I'm
forced to lower my standards on what's publishable and what isn't. I won't lie,
that's going to sting a bit. It doesn't matter how many layers of self-deprecation
I weave on top, I care a lot about the quality of my writing. I place these
high standards, and I adjust and I change words until it feels right. And there's
the issue: the process of editing isn't as fun as the initial step of putting
words onto the page. The end result can be glorious to behold, but it's a long
journey to get there. My brain isn't good enough to understand the long term
reward.

Consider this challenge as part of my long term plan to get better at working
towards long term plans. In the short term, my writing is going to be straight
garbage, but in the long term I'll become much better at articulating
my thoughts. I'll also be better at taking small concrete steps towards
lofty uncertain goals.
