In the past few years, I've learned a very useful trick for pretending to be
wise. When you come across an argument, all you have to do is say something
like this.

> I think boiling this issue down to black and white is an oversimplification.
> There's a lot of ambiguity here. This isn't fiction, where people are
> objectively in the right or wrong, it's reality. It's all full of grey,
> and how grey someone appears is all a matter of perspective.

The beauty of statements like this is that it:

* First identifies a black and white division, which makes it sound like
everyone is on one side or the other.
* Then, proposes such a division is bullshit. Which it is, but the phrasing
makes it sound like that division was there the whole time, when it probably
wasn't.
* Finally, you point out why it's bullshit, and now you're "that guy" who's
floating above the argument.

And the whole time, *I've never stated how I feel about the issue itself.*

Now, I've been trying to cut back on arguments like that, because I want
to get better at actually saying things. But, I'm actually going to use shades
of this argument to explain why I've been finding it hard to blog.

Let's talk about work and play.

These are topics that people absolutely love to bring up when talking
about motivation and productivity. Here's how the argument goes.
People who do lots of work do so because they want to. They find ways
to make work fun. The average employee goes to work to earn a paycheck,
then plays elsewhere. Work to live, not live to work. But these people,
these special people can drive enjoyment our of their work. For them,
work is play, work is fun, and that self-satisfication drives them
to produce at incredible rates.

On one hand, I do agree with parts of this. In general, people who
like their job will do more at their job. It's obvious. And then people
who like hobbies will spend time outside of work on those hobbies.
They'll learn how to dance, or maybe play an instrument. Maybe they'll
organize a D&D campaign.

But fundamentally, doing all these things still requires effort.
Learning an instrument well takes focused practice. Running a D&D campaign
requires someone to craft a plausible setting and characters. There is
real effort there, and personally, sometimes I'm too tired to do something
that I get enjoyment out of.

Being a passive consumer of entertainment is almost zero effort for
reasonable gain. Writing a blog post requires me to put in the time to
write. It may be more personally fulfilling, but after a long day it's hard
to convince my brain to put in *more* time.

If there is work and there is play, then for me blogging is a mix between
the two. I want to write more, but there's this pressure to make the words
I'm writing perfect and well-polished. To make every sentence a clean pearl,
saying exactly what I mean in exactly as many words as I need. The issue is that
it takes a long time to write in a polished way, and that makes blogging
too daunting to do in my spare time.

A few weeks ago, I had a conversation with somebody. She said it was nice to
have a low effort writing outlet. That way, she could write whatever she wanted,
without worrying about having to make it perfect.
