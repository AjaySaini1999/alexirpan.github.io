*This post has several spoilers for the HBO mini-series Chernobyl.
In some ways, you can't really spoil a show about a historical event, but you may
want to skip this post if you haven't seen it before.*

Coronavirus is the new Chernobyl.
Both
are crises caused by something we can't see with the naked eye. Both
spread invisibly, which is incredible for spreading anxiety.
Both started
in authoritarian countries, and both have made scientists the heroes and
trusted officials of the day.

Mechanically, they are very different. Chernobyl is about an exploded
reactor pouring out a fixed amount of radiation per second, and COVID-19
is about a living virus whose spread depends on several other factors. But
the response has felt similar, and that's what's making me disappointed.

The *Chernobyl* mini-series on HBO is really well made, and although it
is not always historically accurate, it's accurate enough to paint some
pretty stark parallels.


Everything is Normal
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's a podcast about creating the Chernobyl mini-series, Craig Mazin,
the writer and executive producer of Chernobyl, talks about the show,
scenes that got cut, and discusses what was real, and what wasn't.

The Chernobyl accident happened on April 26. In a streak of bad luck, May 1
was International Workers' Day, a big holiday for the Soviet Union. By the
time of May 1, party officials were beginning to understand the scope of the problem.
Episode 2 of the podcast briefly mentions that city officials tried to cancel
holiday celebrations, to reduce exposure to radioactive dust carried by the
wind. They failed, because according to the state, Everything Was Normal.

> We're talking about parades. In Kiev, in Minsk, there were party officials
who, it seems to me, begged, BEGGED, to cancel the parade. They were told that
not only would they not cancel the parade, they would be walking in it too. And
they did.

Everything's fine - until it isn't.


Nevermind, This Isn't Normal
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plenty of Soviet disasters got covered up and were only declassified long after
they occured. Chernobyl couldn't be kept a secret, because the wind carried
radioactive particles to Sweden and other European countries, who detected it
on their Geigar counters. After that, it couldn't be kept a secret.

For people close to the
reactor, they were exposed to so many radioactive particles that they began
giving off radiation themselves, from particles that clung to their skin and
clothing.

> There's radioactive dust, she said; close all the windows and plug all the cracks. Later, my anxiety grew when I saw her husband Andrei taking off his clothes and putting them in a plastic bag before entering his apartment.

The crucial difference between radiation and COVID-19 is that radiation
doesn't spread in the same way - it isn't possible for 1 case to grow
into 1 million cases.

Once it was clear the Soviet Union needed to take drastic action, they were
able to do so quickly, thanks to an authoritarian government and a culture
that pushed the collective over the individual.

> So they finally evacuate Pripyat. One thing I was struck [by] was how
orderly it was. 50,000 people are being evacuated from this town, and I could
only think of what that would be like if they tried to do that to a similar
town in America. [...] Everybody just said "whatever" and climbed up onto
the [evacuation] buses.
>
> The citizenry, by all accounts except one, was incredibly orderly. The police
said "you're coming with us. You're coming on the bus. You can take one suitcase
and no pets, and you'll be back in a few days." And everybody just said "okay, I'll
get on the bus." [...] And they never, ever, ever came back [to Pripyat].


Scientists Become Heroes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chernobyl made everyone care a lot more about nuclear physicists. Coronavirus
is making everyone care a lot more about epidemiologists. Valery Legasov is
the protoganist of the Chernobyl mini-series, and in real life he was the chief
of the commission investigating Chernobyl. For the West, he became one of the
faces of the Soviet response, since he presented the Soviet report at a meeting
of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, detailing what happened
in Chernobyl.

Well, now we have Fauci, who is generally popular
([56% trust rating as of May 2](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/05/12/americans-trust-dr-anthony-fauci)),
and one of the figureheads of the Coronavirus Task Force. CDC playbooks for
epidemiology mention that it's important to have a single lead spokesperson,
and to have that spokesperson be a scientist. It's bad if public health becomes
political, because half the country will be more likely to defy public health
for a political point. Based on the partisan divide in Fauci's trust based
on party, it's already too late for the United States. See [this New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/04/seattles-leaders-let-scientists-take-the-lead-new-yorks-did-not)
for more.


Reality Doesn't Care About Politics
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the Chernobyl mini-series is, on its surface, about the events of Chernobyl,
the series is more about how people *responded* to Chernobyl. That's the aspect
I was reminded of first, and the reason I started writing this post.

Chernobyl and COVID-19 aren't really about people. Sure, people are part of
both, but their fundamentals
are grounded in physical reality: infectious disesases for COVID-19, and
radiation for Chernobyl. A worryingly large number of decision makers aren't
respecting reality.

I'm not sure of the historical accuracy of this series, but in the mini-series,
during Episode 3, Legasov and Scherbina are arguing over the size of an evacuation
zone. Legasov learns the evacuation zone has been set to 30 km, and wants it to
be larger. He is overruled, because someone said so.

> Legasov: "How did this happen? Who gave them this idea?"
>
> Scherbina: "Are you suggesting I did?"
>
> Legasov: "Well someone decided the evacuation zone should be 30 km, when we
know-- (points to map) Here! Cesium-137 in Gomel District. Two HUNDRED kilometers
away!"
>
> Scherbina: "It was decided."
>
> Legasov: "Based on WHAT?"
>
> Scherbina: "I don't know."
>
> Legasov: "Forgive me. Maybe I've spent too much time in my lab. Or maybe I'm
> stupid. But is this really how it all works? An uninformed, arbitrary decision
> that will cost who knows how many lives is made by some apparatchik? Some career
> Party man?"

To be a politician, the only thing you have to understand is people. Who they
are, how they think, what they believe, and how to convince them to support you.
That's certainly not easy, it requires some shrewdness,
but there's no particular reason to expect politicians to be good at anything
*besides* navigating structures of power. And in particular, they don't have to
be well-informed about anything, unless it's politically expedient to be
well-informed.
Unfortunately, that approach is exactly what *doesn't* work for the coronavirus.

If the coronavirus was a people problem, maybe you could use charm and wit to
defuse the situation. But it isn't. You can't talk to the coronavirus to
understand what it does and doesn't want. You can't work the room to get the
disease to spread slower. You can't cut a deal with coronavirus to make it
kill fewer people. No, it's there, it exists, and you have to deal with it -
or not.

What you hope, is that you get a politician that gets
it, and they use their experience in navigating deals to get what matters to
the people who need it. By the end of the series, Scherbina is that man.

> Scherbina: I'm an inconsequential man, Valery. I hoped one day I would matter,
but I didn't. I just stood next to people who did.
>
> Legasov: There are other scientists like me. Any one of them could have done what
I did. You-- everything we asked for: men, material, lunar rovers. Who else
could have done these things? They heard me, but they listened to you. [...]
Of all the ministers, and all the deputies, the entire congregation of obedient
fools, they mistakenly sent the one good man. For God's sake Boris, you were the one who mattered most.

There's this phenomenon, where people in politics and PR will repeatedly say
something that isn't true, and if they do this enough, they'll get people
to believe the lie. They'll even start using motivated reasoning to create
their own justification for what you're saying. But that doesn't make it true.


You *can* say things
that aren't true, and get people to believe those things, and for subjects
like the economy, it's complicated enough that motivated reasoning can create
a reasonable argument for your soundbyte. But motivated reasoning stops working
when you're talking about a narrow enough slice of well-studied reality -
like the R0 number of COVID-19. At this point no politician is arguing it is
less contagious than the flu, or less deadly - they're just arguing that it
isn't deadly enough to care.

The problem is that

> The official position of the State is that a global nuclear catastrpohe is not
possible int he Soviet Union. They told the Germans that the highest detected level
of radiation was 2000 roentgen. They gave them the propaganda number. That robot
was never going to work.
