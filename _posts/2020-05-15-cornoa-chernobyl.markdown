*This post has several spoilers for the HBO mini-series Chernobyl.
In some ways, you can't really spoil a show about a historical event, but you may
want to skip this post if you haven't seen it before.*

Coronavirus is the new Chernobyl.
Both
are crises caused by something we can't see with the naked eye.
Both started
in authoritarian countries, and both have made scientists the heroes and
trusted officials of the day.

Mechanically, they are very different. Chernobyl is about an exploded
reactor pouring out radioactive fallout, while COVID-19
is about a living virus. But
the response has felt similar, and that's what's making me disappointed.

The *Chernobyl* mini-series on HBO is really well made, and although it
is not always historically accurate, it's accurate enough to paint some
pretty stark parallels.


Everything is Normal
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Craig Mazin, the writer and executive producer of *Chernobyl*, did a podcast
about the series, where he talks about the show and the historical event.
In episode 2, he mentions one
streak of bad luck that didn't make it to the show.

The Chernobyl accident happened on April 26. Five days later was May 1,
International Workers' Day. This was a big holiday for the Soviet Union, and
in the days before May 1, party officials understood the scope of Chernobyl's
danger. They
wanted to cancel holiday celebrations, to reduce exposure to radioactive dust.
They failed, because the Kremlin told them that Everything Was Normal. Why
would you take precautions when there's nothing to worry about?

Everything's fine - until it isn't. Craig emphasizes that people in the
Soviet Union bureaucracy weren't monsters. They knew it was dangerous to
be outside, but were overruled by those who cared about reputation more
than safety.


Never Mind, This Isn't Normal
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plenty of Soviet disasters got covered up and were only declassified long after
they occurred. Chernobyl couldn't be kept a secret, because the wind carried
radioactive particles to Sweden and other European countries. After that,
it couldn't be kept a secret.

Radioactive fallout is not the same as a virus. A single case of the virus
can multiply and turn into a million cases. Radiation does not replicate this
way. Chernobyl is special because people close to the reactor were exposed to
so much radiation that they ended up giving off radiation themselves.
The firefighter uniforms from that day are [still in the basement of the
abandoned Pripyat hospital](http://www.chernobylgallery.com/galleries/pripyat-hospital/), too radioactive to approach without the
right protective gear.

Nearby countries told their citizens to avoid eating wild game and
vegetables, and to follow basic decontamination measures.

As for the Soviet Union, to their credit, they did take drastic action once it
was clear they had to. Thanks to an authoritarian government and a culture
that pushed the collective over the individual, the evacuation and cleanup
was fairly orderly.

Scientists Become Heroes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chernobyl made everyone care a lot more about nuclear physicists. Coronavirus
is making everyone care a lot more about epidemiologists. Valery Legasov is
the protagonist of the Chernobyl mini-series, and in real life he was the chief
of the commission investigating Chernobyl. For the West, he became one of the
faces of the Soviet response, since he presented the Soviet report at a meeting
of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, detailing what happened
in Chernobyl. He was well-respected for acknowledging failures in the Soviet
response, although his public testimony covered up design flaws in Soviet
nuclear reactor design.

Now we have Fauci, who is generally popular
([56% trust rating as of May 2](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/05/12/americans-trust-dr-anthony-fauci)),
and one of the figureheads of the Coronavirus Task Force. The GCDC playbook for
communication mentions the importance of having a single lead spokesperson
who's a scientist, not a politician.
Having a single spokesperson increases trust because of familiarity, and making
that person a scientist reduces risk of politicizing the disease. If half the
country trusts the CDC less because of a culture war, it's a disaster
for public health.
See [this New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/04/seattles-leaders-let-scientists-take-the-lead-new-yorks-did-not)
for more.

According to the YouGov study above, Fauci's 56% trust rating is split 68%
among Democrats and 48% among Republicans. It is already too late
for the United States.


Reality Doesn't Care About Politics
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Chernobyl mini-series is ostensibly about the events of Chernobyl, but it's
really more about how people *responded* to Chernobyl. That's the aspect
I was reminded of first, and the reason I started writing this post.

Chernobyl and COVID-19 aren't really about people. Sure, people are part of
both, but their fundamentals
are grounded in physical reality: infectious diseases for COVID-19, and
radiation for Chernobyl. It's like the classic Philip K. Dick quote: "Reality
is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away." A worryingly
large number of decision makers aren't respecting reality.

I'm not sure of the historical accuracy of this moment, but in Episode 3
of the mini-series, "Open Wide, O Earth",
Legasov and Scherbina are arguing over the size of an evacuation
zone. Legasov learns the evacuation zone has been set to 30 km, and wants it to
be much, much larger. He is overruled.

> Legasov: "How did this happen? Who gave them this idea?"

This is worth emphasizing: **no one is forced to do things that make sense.**
To be a politician, the only thing you have to understand is people. Who they
are, how they think, what they believe, and how to convince them to support you.
That's certainly not easy, it requires you to be shrewd and to have a good
read of people.
But there's no particular reason to expect politicians to be good at anything
*besides* navigating structures of power. They don't have to
be well-informed about anything, unless it's politically expedient to be
well-informed.
Unfortunately, that approach is exactly what *doesn't* work for the coronavirus.

If the coronavirus was a people problem, maybe you could use charm and wit to
defuse the situation. But you can't.
You can't talk to the coronavirus to
understand what it does and doesn't want. You can't work the room to get the
disease to spread slower. You can't cut a deal with coronavirus to make it
kill fewer people. No, it's there, it exists, and you have to deal with it -
or not. This has been repeated elsewhere, but all political instincts are
wrong at the start of a pandemic, and you pay a price if those instincts aren't
overruled.

You hope you get a politician that understands the problem, has the
grit to take unfavorable actions, and they use their experience in
navigating deals to get what matters to
the people who need it. By the end of the series, Scherbina is that man.

There's this phenomenon, where people in politics and PR will repeat something
that isn't true, and if they do so often enough, people will believe it.
Those people will even start using motivated reasoning to create
their own justification for what you're saying. This works for subjects
that are complicated enough to have ambiguity in their causality, but it doesn't
work very well for the narrow slice of reality that COVID-19 occupies.

In episode 4, "For the Happiness of All Mankind", the Soviet Union explores
using robots to clear debris off the Chernobyl reactor roof. Radiation damages electronics.
The Soviet robots they had from the Space Race could withstand some radiation, but not
the highest levels of radiation detected on the roof.

Through tense off-screen negotiations, they get a robot from West Germany which
can withstand the reported numbers. They try it out, and the robot fails
immediately. Scherbina soon learns why.

Think about this for a second. Someone high up in the government decided to give
a propaganda number, instead of a real one. That filtered all the way down the
bureaucracy, down to the people figuring out how to borrow a robot from the West.
That one lie, from someone who cared more about reputation than accuracy, wasted
the time
of the negotiators, of the robot constructors from West Germany, of the
technicians who operated it - all of it, gone.

I cannot think of a better argument for why you should care who your boss is,
and who your elected officials are. If technology is a multiplier of both good
and bad, then power is too. What does it say when [both Republican and Democrat
governors hid flight details of testing and PPE shipments from the
federal government](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/495519-maryland-governor-says-coronavirus-tests-acquired-from-south-korea-under),
to avoid confiscation? It's just absurd.

The central theme of the *Chernobyl* mini-series is truth, and the lies surrounding it.
This was why the showrunners tried to stay historically accurate. They thought
it would be cheap to send a message about truth that was wrapped in artistic lies,
and reality was dramatic enough. When the inevitable COVID-19 documentaries arrive,
I hope they make the same decision.
