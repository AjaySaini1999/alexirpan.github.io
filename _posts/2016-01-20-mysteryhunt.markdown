*Targeted towards people who did MIT Mystery Hunt 2016. I doubt you'll
care about this if you didn't participate. Spoilers.*

Here's the thing about puzzle hunts: they bring together the strangest
people. Strange in a good way. The biggest reason puzzles are awesome is
because they provide concentrated bursts of problem solving euphoria,
but only the slightly unhinged are willing to destroy
their sleep schedules by working on puzzles for 3 days straight. Still,
any week where I get to hear proposals for sneakernet from space to Earth is
pretty awesome.

Thanks to sponsors, at the start of this Hunt, every team got Google Cardboard,
Fitbit notebooks, and Fitbit pens. In a true display of Mystery Hunt paranoia, the first thing
we did was open the notebooks and disassemble a pen to verify none of them were
puzzles. I blame the first aid kit from the Alice hunt.

After kickoff, my first puzzle of the Hunt was [You Complete Me](http://huntception.com/puzzle/you_complete_me/).
We got the correct coefficients after some staring, but it took us a while to
get the next square a-ha. Once we did, we got stuck on extraction and abandoned it.
The next day, someone looked at it, did the obvious thing, and solved it in
five minutes. In hindsight, I have no idea how we missed it.

Had fun finding the solution to [Pictocryptolists](http://huntception.com/puzzle/pictocryptolists/). As with all substitution ciphers,
it took a while to get the first foothold, but once we got the theme it came
together like clockwork. Around five people cycled through it.
It was straightforward with lots of work, so we used it as a cooldown puzzle
for people frustrated by their current one.

Oh, for once I actually found a meta mechanism! It was for [Obedience Training](http://huntception.com/puzzle/obedience_training/).
We were very confident in ????PROOF BREEDERS, where exactly two of the ? were
consonants, but it took us until Sunday to guess the correct starting word.
(It was GOOFPROOF, for what it's worth. I know it's on theme, but FOOLPROOF
makes so much sense...)

[Meet the Loremipsumstanis](http://huntception.com/puzzle/meet_the_loremipsumstanis/) was frustrating. Everyone collected data for it once
we figured out how to decode the Bacon Ipsum because it was too much fun to
justify working on anything else. It was all smooth sailing, until we
got to the final cryptic phrase. We knew the answer had to be eight letters long
from both the given numbers and the Rip Van Winkle meta constraint, but we
just couldn't get it, and the puzzle stayed unsolved for all of Hunt.
I'm still so disappointed TONY HAWK wasn't correct.

I finally found a use for my knowledge of Knuth up-arrow notation! ...Well, I
would have, if I hadn't looked at [Identify, SORT, Index, Solve](http://huntception.com/puzzle/identify_sort_index_solve/) five hours
after it was solved. As a fan of incredibly large numbers,
I'm sad I missed it.
Any puzzle involving Busy Beavers and Ackermann functions is automatically
awesome. Based on the Mystery Hunt subreddit, other people liked it too, so
hopefully I'll get another chance to reason about exponent towers.

Now, a slight digression. A ton of puzzles came out between Saturday night and Sunday
morning, but I didn't work on them. Instead, I was doing Round 1 of Facebook
Hacker Cup. Take it from me, starting a programming competition at 2 AM after
doing puzzles all day was an awful decision. I briefly looked at
the problems, decided there was no way I could get the last one, and focused on
the first three. I did very minimal testing, submitting my last solution
5 seconds before the contest ended.
Miraculously, they were all correct.
I expect to die in Round 2, and will be very surprised if I make
top 500 for the T-shirt, but at least I made it.

Back to puzzles! Shortly after coming into HQ, somebody called out ["Ponies!"](http://huntception.com/puzzle/missing_the_mark/).
I've always felt like Mystery Hunt had to have an My Little Pony puzzle at some point,
and this year someone on the writing team felt the same way.
We solved it in around forty minutes, seamlessly going from data
collection to a-ha to extraction. On point construction, clean theming, solvable
without MLP knowledge but much faster with it, and the final answer was on point.
My second most enjoyable solve of the Hunt.

But, my favorite solve of the Hunt has to go to [Sleeping Beauty meta](http://huntception.com/round/sleeping_beauty/). I
didn't know Nikoli created a logic puzzle with no numbers, but now I
do. Everyone else did the legwork of filling in the grid and solving
with incomplete info, but we got stuck on final extraction Sunday morning and abandoned
it. Around twenty-five minutes before the end of Hunt, I gave a final look, and
figured it out. Let me tell you, it feels really good to solve a meta,
and it feels even better to be the reason it was solved in the first place.

We weren't close to finishing, but I never expected to finish, so that
was fine. I'm very curious to see what kind of hunt Setec will make.
After seeing Sneakers, I'll say only this: Setec can have Too Many Secrets,
as long as they don't have Too Many Puzzles.

Finally, for tradition's sake: this post is not a puzzle.

(Just kidding, it is. Yes, really.
If something seems sketchy, look at the remainder. You'll need some more
numbers, and here they are: 16, 5, 16, 23, 9, 25, 23.)
