I've played Magic: the Gathering on and off for nearly 15 years. It's a
great card game, with tons of depth. It's only downside is that it can get
pretty expensive. So when I heard
Wizards of the Coast was working on a free-to-play version called MTG Arena, I
signed up for the beta. I was lucky enough to get an invite, and the beta's
recently went out of NDA, so I figured I'd give some first impressions.

This is the first digital implementation of Magic I've
ever played. So far, the implementation feels smooth.
The animations add a bit without getting in the way, and rules-wise I've yet
to hit any problems. I have run into issues with the auto-tap though. In one game,
I was playing a UB control deck, and played one of my finishers with Cancel
backup. I didn't realize the auto-tap had tapped all my Islands until my
opponents turn, and it made me lose. But I chalk that up to unfamiliarity
with the interface. It was a one-off mistake and I haven't lost like that since.

At times, I've also found it annoying to clear the stack
when a lot of triggers happen at once, but I'm willing to accept that as a
consequence of Magic's rules engine. It doesn't "pop" as much as Hearthstone
does, but the core gameplay is a lot more interesting to me, and that's what's
bringing me back.

The experience in the first few days after the NDA drop was pretty magical.
Everyone's account got wiped, and you can't spend real money yet.
Not only was everyone on a level playing
field, no one could pay-to-win their way to a strong deck.
The end result was like a massive, worldwide Sealed league. For the
uninitiated, Sealed is a Magic format where every player gets 6 booster packs
and builds a deck out of those cards.
A Sealed league is a Sealed tournament that runs over several weeks.
Every 1-2 weeks, players add an extra booster pack to their card pool.

Arena is essentially in a similar state, thanks to the slow unlock rate.
And therein lies the problem. Most people have terrible decks, because it's
currently very difficult to build good ones, even if you spend a lot of time
playing the game.

Now, I was planning on writing a post complaining about the economy,
but then [I read a really good post that covered everything I wanted to cover](https://rngeternal.com/2018/03/28/going-deep-analyzing-the-mtga-economy/),
and I realized I had nothing to add.
Instead, I'll share some points I realized.

I have a lot more respect for Hearthstone's core economy. I don't like
where Hearthstone's gameplay has gone, but the core dusting and crafting
mechanics are well designed. 30 card decks with at most 2 copies of a card
makes it easier to build a collection. The 3rd copy of every card can be
disenchanted for free, and the 1st and 2nd copy can be disenchanted too if you
don't think that card will be useful in the future.
In MTG Arena, I have to open 4 copies of a common before I can make progress
towards the Vault, which is Arena's equivalent of disenchanting.

The developers of MTG Arena said they decided against a disenchant system
because it created feel-bad moments when people disenchanted cards they needed
later. That's true, but in its place they've created feel-bad
moments when players open cards they don't want, with little choice on how
to turn them into cards they do want. I own several commons where I have 3 unplayed
copies of the same card, and I can't do anything with them.

At a broader level, I've started appreciating the fragility of things.
The best part of my MTG Arena experience was at the beginning, when everything was new,
people were still figuring out the meta, and draft chaff decks were competitive.
Nothing about that environment was going to last, but I didn't expect it to.
In many ways it reminds me of the early years of the brony fandom. A ton of
ridiculous stuff happened, and no one knew where the fandom was going, but just
being on the ride was exciting. The first BronyCon must have been insane, because
I doubt there was a good understanding for what a brony convention should aspire
to be.

The fandom has cooled down since then. Content creators settled in. Conventions
have become more like institutions. Season 3 didn't help, given that it was
disappointing compared to Seasons 1 and 2. The fandom's
still going - Season 8 premiered last week - but it's condensed into something
that's lost a lot of its initial magic.

The question is whether people should have expected the brony fandom to keep
its magic forever. On reflection, ponies were never going to stay as culturally
visible as they were in 2012 or 2013. I feel a heavy part of the fandom's growth was
its unexpectedness. Very few people expected a reboot of My Little Pony
to actually be good, and it was that surprise that pulled people in. Now that
people know it's a cartoon that people like, there's less pressure to see what
all the fuss is about.

There's nothing wrong with that. Cultural touchstones come and go. But if your definition of "fandom"
is calibrated to the peak insanity of that fandom, then
everything afterwards is going to be a disappointment. I saw a Reddit post asking if research in deep learning was
slowing down. I don't think it is, but I do feel there have been fewer
fundamental architecture shifts. There were a few years where every
state-of-the-art ImageNet model introduced a new idea, and if you were watching
the field at that time, the field would have looked ridiculously open. It's a
lot less ridiculous now.

I'm not a big fandom jumper. I tend to get into a
few fandoms, and then stick with them for a long, long time. And for a while,
I looked down on people who did jump fandoms. It felt like they were
chasing the high of the new thing, that they were in love with the collective
enthusiasm of fandom, instead of the work the fandom was based on. I didn't
see them as "true fans", because as soon as the next new thing came around,
they'd leave.
I don't look down on this behavior anymore. If that's what people are looking
for, who am I to judge?

It's just that if the community does get worse, I don't think
it's productive to complain about "the good old days."
Analyzing it or trying to fix it is fine,
but I suspect that many communities start because of forces outside of their
control. People get pulled in, those outside forces go away, and then when
things change, people blame the community for "ruining things", or
"destroying the fandom", instead of blaming
the disappearance of the outside forces that made the community grow in the
first place.

The thing that gets people into a community doesn't have to be the thing that
gets people to stay. There's even a [TVTropes page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/ComeForTheXStayForTheY)
for this. If the community starts getting worse, maybe the problem isn't
the community. Maybe the problem is that you were pulled in by something that
the community was never really about. And if you can't
change that, then the easiest thing to do is to leave with the memories of the
good times you had.
