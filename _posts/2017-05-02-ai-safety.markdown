I've been trying to write this post for almost a year.

That doesn't mean I've been actively writing that whole time. It's more
like a constant nagging feeling, that refuses to go away.

I wrote a draft 6 months ago (CHECK TIME), then erased the whole thing out
of disgust. I have notes jotted down 8 months ago that I don't fully endorse
anymore.

Everything's jumbled, a giant cacophony of latent beliefs and hazy thoughts.
At this point, I just want it to be *done*, because I'm sick of bottling
up my monologues. The problem is that my opinions on the subject are tied
to so much of my life that it's hard to look at them, even subjectively.

I can't even write this unless I make the following very, very clear.

* These are my opinion as of the time of this post (May 29, 2017), and
my feelings are very likely to change.
* These are my personal opinions - they do not reflect the opinions of
anybody I have worked with or any organization that has employed me.
* No, seriously, **these opinions are mine.** If you don't realize how
sensitive talking about AI safety is...well, hopefully I can explain it.

I feel like the conversations people have about AI are broken.

To be more specific, they're broken in ways that make me actively avoid most
online discussion about AI. This is definitely a problem.

Throughout this essay, I'll use "the strawman rationalist". The strawman
rationalist will be denoted by *italics*. The strawman rationalist is not
fair. It does not match any self-described rationalist I know. It's more
like an amalgam of all the negative rationalist stereotypes I can think of.
