*These are my personal opinions. They do not reflect the opinions of anybody
I have worked with. AI safety gets very sensitive very fast, and I
want to make __extra__ sure that people are aware of this.*


I feel like the conversations people have about AI are broken. Or to be more
specific, they're broken in ways that make me disengage from any conversations
about AI safety, and that feels like a problem.

Throughout this essay, I'll use "the strawman rationalist". The strawman
rationalist will be denoted by *italics*. The strawman rationalist is not
fair. It does not match any self-described rationalist I know. It's more
like an amalgam of all the negative rationalist stereotypes I can think of.
