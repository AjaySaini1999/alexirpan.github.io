I'll be honest: I completely forgot to prepare a post for my two year
blogging anniversary until today. I'm vaguely disgusted that "two year
blogging anniversary" is a valid English phrase, but sometimes languages
are silly like that.

Ironically this is because I've been working on a larger post that's been
taking up most of my writing time. Hopefully I get that done soon.

I do feel I've been less productive this year than last year, blogging wise.
Let's see if that's backed up empirically. Now, word count is a pretty bad
metric for writing time, because in my experience most of writing is rewriting.
But it's the best metric I've got. Here's a list of all posts I wrote this
year, along with their word count.

So, I wrote around 17,000 fewer words this year. What changed?

\* \* \*
{: .centered }

The most important change is that I'm been working full time the entire year.
It's been a lot harder for me to get side projects done than it was in college.
This is a well-known experience with well-known explanations, but let me explain
anyways.

In college, I didn't have designated work times. I went to class, I had lunch
and dinner, and the rest of the day was a blend between work and free time.
It was very easy for me to work for 20 minutes, switch to playing *Dustforce*
for 40 minutes, blog for 10 minutes, flowing back and forth depending on mood until 3 AM.
Then I would wake up the next morning and start the process over again.

It was even easier for me to do this because I didn't have many group projects,
and I had very few homework groups or study groups. Overall there was no
accountability on my schedule, and the blending was a natural consequence of that.

This wasn't a bad thing. I wasn't very focused, but at any time there was a chance
I could switch to being productive, and the activation barrier between everything
was much lower. Blogging slotted itself very naturally into my day. (Well, more
like into my night.)

All that has changed. I have meetings, coworkers, managers. I'm working on a
project with collaborators across three offices.
Coordination is a lot easier if everybody's working times overlap - one of my
collaborators works from London, and he's deliberately shifted his schedule
forward because the only good meeting time is his evenings (which are our
mornings in California).

It's the same problem that most companies have, and there's a shared solution:
a homogenized schedule with similar working hours. When I was a student, I
worked more, but the
work was spread out over the entire week, like maple syrup on pancakes.
Sure, sometimes I didn't finish work until 2 AM. But I had relaxed enough
during the afternoon to make this feel okay.

In a job, all the work gets compressed into a single block.
I do take breaks, and I'm lucky enough to work at a company that doesn't
care how long your break is...as long as you get your work done. That nagging
feeling of getting my work done means I don't take a lot of breaks.

The end result is that my energy and motivation gets spent at work in one
big burst. By the time I get home it's hard to do much more than browse
the Internet and play games.

I've thought a bit about whether I can reproduce the college working schedule,
so to speak, but there are benefits to working similar hours to everybody else.
Overall I don't think there's a lot of value in changing how I work.

Okay, time for more uplifting news! In [last year's post]({% post_url 2016-08-18-one-year %}),
I mentioned a few posts I said I would write this year! Let's see how I did.

> The post about *Gunnerkrigg Court* is going to happen. I swear it will.

Uhhhh, that post didn't happen. Okay, next!

> I wrote the start of a really, really stupid short story about dinosaurs. [...]
> I hope that story sees the light of day, because the premise is so stupid
> that it might just wrap back around to brilliant.

That one didn't happen either. Alright, what else did I say I was
going to work on.

Oh, I said I was going to write a post about AI safety! That one is in progress!
And not done! A bit far from done, in fact, but let's round that up to a win.
If [failure is success rounded down](http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=955),
then surely success is failure rounded up.

To be serious for a bit: yes, I am a bit disappointed I haven't written posts
that I said I wanted to write. But I'm not actually that disappointed. It
feels like I'm spent about as much time writing as I wanted to spend this year.

Well, maybe I've written a bit less than I wanted to.

Let's say I'm more at peace and leave it at that.

In terms of life trajectory: I didn't apply to PhD programs, mostly out of
laziness. I should have applied, just to keep the option open, but I don't see
myself going to academia any time soon, unless my research interests or work
drastically change.

I think I've changed less this year compared to last year. Again, this is
a common sentiment.
I found it easy to grow every year of college - it just happened naturally.
I've been finding it harder to do so after leaving that environment.

When I think about what I would regret the most, it's something like this: the
worry that five years from now, I'll look back on my life, and have no idea
where five years of my life went. Something kind of like this.

It's that worry that pushes me to work on things, even when I have reasons not to.

Will pre-emptively thinking about [quarter-life crises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-life_crisis)
stop me from having a quarter-life crisis? Eh, maybe. We'll find out.

I think I've rambled long enough. Two years down. Here's to two more.
