I will be honest: I completely forgot to prepare a post for my two year
blogging anniversary until today. (I am vaguely disgusted that "two year
blogging anniversary" is something I would say, but sometimes that's the way
it is.)

Ironically this is because I've been working on a larger post that's been
taking up most of the time I've dedicated to writing. Hopefully I get that out
soon.

I do feel I've been less productive this year than last year, blogging wise.
How about we see if that's backed up empiricially? Now, word count is an awful
metric for time spent writing, but it's the best one I have for now. Between
today and one year ago, I wrote...

Over 39 thousand words. What changed?

\* \* \*
{: .centered }

The most important change is that I started working full-time June of last year.
Before then, I was balancing blogging with being a college student. Now I'm
balancing it with work.

It's a very well-known experience, but it's been quite a lot harder for me to
get side projects done than it was in college. And again, it's well-known
why that's true, but let me explain anyway.

When I was in college, I didn't
have designated work times. I went to class, I had lunch and dinner, and work and
free time blended together in the rest of the day. It was very easy for me to
work for 20 minutes, switch to playing *Dustforce* for 40 minutes, blog for 10
minutes, all flowing back and forth depending on mood until 3 AM. Then waking
up at 10 AM to start the whole process over again.

I had few group projects, and no study groups, and therefore no accountability
on my schedule. Not a very focused way to work, but it made it easy to slot
blogging whenever I wanted to do it - the activation barrier was low.

But now, I'm in a group project. I have meetings, coworkers, managers, and
coordination is a lot easier if everybody's working times overlap by enough.
One person working on my project is living in London, and he deliberately
starts work late and leaves late. That's because his evenings are mornings
in California, and it's the only way we can ever have meetings.

I'd say that I worked more when I was a student, but it spread itself out
like a big morass over the entire week, never concentrating too tightly.
In a job...it all compresses into a single block. I do take breaks, and luckily
I have a tech job, where in principle I can take whatever breaks I want. In
practice there's always a nagging feeling that I should get my work done so
that I can leave the office.

End result: I'm much more tired earlier in the day, which makes it hard to
bring up motivation to do anything more than browsing the Internet, which
makes it harder to devote more time to blogging, which means I don't get as
much writing done.

So, consider this an apology post, that will maybe make me write more, but
realistically it depends on how the rest of me feels about it.

Okay, time for more uplifting news! Let's look at the posts I said I would
write this year!

> The post about *Gunnerkrigg Court* is going to happen. I swear it will.

Uhhhh, well, that post didn't happen. Okay, next!

> I wrote the start of a really, really stupid short story about dinosaurs. [...]
> I hope that story sees the light of day, because the premise is so stupid
> that it might just wrap back around to brilliant.

That one didn't happen either. Uhhh, alright, what else did I say I was
going to work on.

Oh, I said I was going to write a post about AI safety! That one is in progress!
And not done! A bit far from done, in fact, but let's round that up to a win.
If failure is success rounded down, then surely success is failure rounded up.

To be serious for a bit: yes, I am a bit disappointed I haven't written posts
that I've wanted to write for over a year. But I'm not actually that
disappointed - it feels like I'm spent about as much time writing as I want to
spend. Well, maybe I've written a bit less than I wanted to.

Let's say I'm slightly more at peace and leave it at that.

In terms of life trajectory: I skipped applying to PhD programs because I was
a bit lazy, I can still do the research I want to do in my current job, and I'm
getting paid.

I think I've changed less this year compared to last year. Again, I hear this
is common. It's very easy to drastically change every year of college. It's
much harder to do so when you leave that environment.

When I think about what I would regret the most, it's something like this: the
worry that five years from now, I'll look back on my life, and have no idea
where five years of my life went. Something kind of like this.

It's that worry that pushes me to try to do things, even when I have reasons
not to.

Will pre-emptively thinking about [quarter-life crises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-life_crisis)
stop me from having a quarter-life crisis? Eh, maybe. Again, we'll find out.

I think I've rambled long enough. Two years down, and here's to two more.
