I read a lot more web fiction than the average, probably because I have a barely functioning
social life. Almost all stories I've read the past few years were published
online. There's something very addicting about being able to read a story wherever
I have Internet access. With smartphones, that means practically anywhere.

On one hand, I've missed out on very good books that were published
traditionally. On the other hand, I'm slightly more qualified to recommend
stories that people wouldn't normally hear about.

I intend to write more in-depth reviews for some of these recommendations.
To stop this page frmo getting to unwieldly, **every recommendation that doesn't
link to a full blog post review gets three sentences max.**

For now, I'm restricting myself to text only content. No webcomics, no audio plays,
no video series or animations.

Within each category, stories are ordered by how much I enjoyed them.


Stories are organized by fandom, then quality, then author. Within each subcategory,
grouping works by author takes priority over ordering by quality.

Stories labeled with a ** are good enough that I recommend them even if you are
unfamiliar with the source material.


FAVORITES

My all time favorites. The other works are good, but these are better.

Worm, by Wildbow
Status: Completed
https://parahumans.wordpress.com/about/

Superpowers are real. They first appeared a few decades ago, and now they're
a part of society. Has an incredibly large cast of characters that play off
each other very organically. Dark tone with very juicy action.

Fallout Equestria, by kkat (MLP x Fallout)
Status: Completed
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/119190/fallout-equestria

I recommend trying this even if you don't know about either MLP or Fallout.
I liked it that much.

If you liked Worm, Fallout Equestria is more of the same.
Wonderful ensemble cast, a world dripping with potential, terrifyingly good
action, and lots of moral ambiguity to go around.
When the author makes a pool of water one of the
scariest encounters in the series, you know something is going right.


ORIGINAL CONTENT

No fandom needed to enjoy.

Pact, by Wildbow
Status: Completed

Modern supernatural. Strong start that peters out in the middle, but the final
arcs make up for it.


Twig, by Wildbow
Status: In Progress (updates 2-3 times a week.)
https://twigserial.wordpress.com/about/

Biopunk. Fun set of characters. The big picture is still unclear, but so far
thi shas been entertaining.



Ra, by qntm
Status: Completed
http://qntm.org/ra

Magic is real.

Magic is also a science. It may break the laws of physics, but it still follows
the laws of magic, and it's not clear what those are. Did you really think
you could pick up a wand and launch sparks? How is creating all that
thermal and kinetic energy out of nothing supposed to be easy?

Entertaining hard science fiction. There is no shame in looking up concepts
you don't know; this is a story that cites Godel's Incompleteness
Theorems in relevant context.


Fine Structure, by qntm
Status: Completed
http://qntm.org/structure

Another hard science fiction story. Told from many perspectives through
parallel storied that eventually converge into a coherent narrative.
The height of my addiction was in my second reading of the story, not the first.

The characters in Fine Structure aren't that amazing - often, characters act as
ways for the author to express ideas about how the world works, instead of as
characters with personality and agency. However, the ideas are interesting enough
to make up for this.

Avoid reading the comments. They will spoil you, even if you don't realize what
you're getting spoiled on.


Other stories, by qntm
http://qntm.org/fiction

Sam Hughes has a lot of science fiction short stories on his site.
Recommended ones:
- I don't know, Timmy, being God is a big responsibility
- The Difference
- The Last-But-One Question
- Causal Noose
- Gorge


HARRY POTTER

Yer a wizard, Harry.

Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality
Status: Completed
http://hpmor.com/

Harry grows up with an Oxford professor as his father, and spends his childhood
reading books about science. Then, he gets a letter from Hogwarts...

This tends to be a love it or hate it story, so I would recommend just reading
it to see where you lie.


Harry Potter and the Natural 20 (Harry Potter x D&D)
Status: Unfinished, possibly dead
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20

A munchkin from the D&D universe drops into the Harry Potter universe. Their
systems of magic collide, and hilarity ensues. If you like creative rule-bending
or self-aware characters, this story is for you.

Note the author actually rolls every dice in the story, to give encounters
more authenticity.

MY LITTLE Pony: Friendship is Magic

You may have destroyed the Elements, but you can't destory the most powerful
magic of all: the magic of friendship!

MLP Loops (MLP x everything)
Status: Ongoing
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheInfiniteLoops

The multiversal computer that powers all possible realities is malfunctioning.
As a stopgap, the Admins are running reality on repeat while they fix the damage.
This sticks MLP (and every other reality) into a Groundhog Day time loop.

A strangely addictive anthology of short stories. Often irreverent, usually
funny, but occasionally realistic and down to earth.

Spoils MLP up through the Season 3 finale, since the story started soon after that
aired. Over time it incoporates Season 4 and Season 5 material.


Hard Reset, by Eakin
Status: Complete
LINK

Twilight Sparkle is having a bad day. First, an experimental spell blows up in her
face and gets her stuck in a time loop. Second, an alien invasion is coming to
destroy the city. She's going to stop the invasion, even if it kills here.
Which it will. A lot.

Think Edge of Tomorrow, but darker, with more emphasis on psychological damage.
Pretty short with a very nice ending chapter.

Followed by A Stitch in Time (romantic comedy with some adventure), then concluded
by You Can Fight Fate (adventure).

Hard Reset spoils through Season 2 finale. Stitch and Fate spoil through
Season 3 finale.


Friendship is Optimal, by ___
Status: Complete
LINK

Set in the human world. Hanna is a developer at _____ Studios, and after the success
of their procedurally generated MMO ____, they've been contacted to make an MMO
for MLP. And thus CelestAI is created...

At its core, this is a story about AI, not about the people. It makes it somewhat
alien to read through, but I still liked it.

Does not spoil anything, and you don't even need MLP knowledge to read this.

The Law Offices of Artemis, Stell, and Beat
Status: Complete
LINK

Fan-fanfiction based on the Friendship is Optimal universe. I liked this over
Friendship is Optimal because it's grounded more in human interaction.
Unfortunately, you do need to read about 2/3rd of Friendship is Optimal to
appreciate this.

Also does not spoil anything from MLP.


A Taste of The Good Life, by Eakin (LINK)
Status: Complete
LINK

Slice of life story that stays light throughout. The plot is predictable from a mile
away, but that doesn't make it bad because the execution is solid.
Eakin gets a lot of mileage out of short, simple sentences,

Very light spoilers through Season 2


WORM

Doing the wrong things for the right reasons.

Cenotaph, by notes
Status: Completed
LINK

An original flavor AU where Taylor is a hero instead of a villain. Although,
"hero" and "villain" don't mean much when it comes to Worm...

If you liked Worm, you will probably like Cenotaph (and Cenotaph is also much
shorter.)

Followed by Wake, then Legacy. Wake is completed and Legacy is in progress.

Manager, by Sereviel
Status: In Progress
LINK

Taylor got the Adminstrator power. What if that power was more literal?

Basically, Taylor's power is completely broken, and she uses it to troll
the entire setting. At the same time, her power still has limits, and she avoids
Mary Sue issues. Lighthearted and all around fun.
