Things I Have Read Online That You Can Only Read Online Which You Should Read Online

This should really be a blog post, not a Facebook post. However, my
blog is currently really ugly (it's the default Blogspot template) and I'd rather
have it look at least somewhat good before posting new things to it.

So! Why am I making this post? Well, I've noticed that I've read a lot more web
only content than the average, which is probably because I both have no social
life and either become bored or obsessed with fandoms, with very little middle
ground. The vast majority of stories I've read over the past few years are
ones published online; there's something very addicting about a story that I can
read anywhere I have internet. (Which is anywhere at all because I have a smartphone.)
This means I've probably missed out on some very good books that came out recently,
but it also means I'm actually vaquely qualified to recommend stories to people.
Hooray! Let's get to it.

Stories are organized by fandom, then quality, then author. Within each subcategory,
grouping works by author takes priority over ordering by quality.

Stories labeled with a ** are good enough that I recommend them even if you are
unfamiliar with the source material.

For space, I've unfortunately had to leave off webcomics. There are some that I
really want to gush about (read Gunnerkrigg Court NOW) but this is already
getting unwieldy.


GENERAL (stories with no pre-requisite knowledge):

Worm, by Wildbow
https://parahumans.wordpress.com/about/

Worm is within my top 3 stories I've ever read. It's so, so excellent. Honestly,
the about page linked above is a better summary than I can give, but I'll try.

The premise of Worm is that it's a world where superpowers are real. That's the
only difference. Otherwise, everything is played as realistically as possible.
Characters use their powers with as much ingenuity and cleverness as they can manage,
injuries don't magically go away from chapter to chapter, and pointing out why the
world is wrong doesn't make turning it right any easier. For that matter, whether
something is right or wrong in the first place depends heavily on context and
which character is making that decision.

As stories go, it's pretty dark, but the action is gripping and the actions of
all the characters flow organically from their characterization. I'm still surprised at
how often I got scared that a character would die. (And characters do die. A lot.)

In my opinion, the last third of chapters aren't as great, but they're still solid, and until
then it's a great page turner. (Or is it mouse clicker when you're on the internet?)

The story is looooooooong, but definitely worth it.

Pact, by Wildbow
https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/about/

The second web serial written by wildbow, also completed. Although I enjoyed Pact,
it's definitely not as good.

If Worm is a modernized superhero story, then Pact is a modernized
supernatural story. Unlike Worm, which attempts to give an explanation for
how different powers work, Pact is deliberately vague in how different monsters
act and how the magic system actually works. It's also very dark, darker than Worm.
When you read the story, you get a sense of isolation for many of the chapters,
and that can be emotionally draining.

Starts out strong, meanders a lot towards its middle, then has some absolutely
fantastic final arcs. Much shorter than Worm, but still pretty lengthy. Still reccomend
reading Worm first.

Twig, by Wildbow
https://twigserial.wordpress.com/about/

The third serial by Wildbow, in progress. I'm not caught up on it, I'm currently
around 10 chapters behind present day (at the start of Arc 3). Updated 2-3 times a week.

So far I've enjoyed Twig, but I haven't read enough to have a strong opinion on it.
Setting is biopunk, characters are fun. Still don't know what the big picture is
like, but there's been some interesting details revealed.


Ra, by qntm
http://qntm.org/ra

Magic is real.

Magic is also a science. People like to think they can pick up a wand, say "Fireball!"
and fire will spout out from their wand and go towards the person they're pointing it at,
as if the creation of thermal and kinetic energy is that simple.
That's not how magic works. Not here.

It took a while for me to get into Ra, but once I did I got hooked. I'd say
I liked it for sure around either "Magic Isn't" or "The Jesus Machine". "The Jesus Machine"
is actually a decent short story on its own, although I still recommend starting
from the beginning.

There's some wonderfully dry humor, and it's very engaging to see the rules of magic slowly
get unravelled. This is by far the nerdiest story of the bunch.
It's hard science fiction, and you should be prepared to look up a few things while
you're reading. This is a story where magic has been proven to have generally-unsolvable
fluid dynamics equations. It's also a story where a character says "Fuck the natural
logirithm!" when talking about the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, and where someone mentions
GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorem in a relevant context. Computer science puns abound
everywhere you look (and a few places you don't), and I'm sure I've missed a couple
things that went over my head.

By the author's own admission, the story changes in scope and tone when the inner
workings of magic finally get revealed. Until then, it's fantastic. After that point,
your mileage may vary, but I still enjoyed it.

Fine Structure, by qntm
http://qntm.org/structure

Fine Structure is a weird story to talk about. The more you think about it, the better
it becomes, and the height of my addiction was in my second readthrough of the story,
not the first.

The core drive of Fine Structure is similar to Ra. The world acts in strange
ways, and you're reading to get explanations of why things are happening the way
they are. These details are revealed in multiple short stories that are both
running in parallel and told out of order. They eventually converge and form one
coherent narrative, but it's a wild journey to get there.

Without spoiling too much, the main storylines are:

- Every year, someone on Earth is struck by lightning and gains superpowers.
Each year's power is twice as strong as the last. This has been happening for 10 years.
- When working on a new form of communications technology, a research group gets
a signal of 60 trillion binary digits. It starts with the primes from
2 to 127, then starts defining mathematical notation. Then things get complicated.
- One day, a man wakes up with the power to walk through solid objects. It comes
naturally to him, as though he knew how to do it all his life, but he has no memory
of ever using it before.

The characters in Fine Structure aren't that amazing - often, characters act as
ways for the author to express ideas about how the world works, instead of as
characters with personality and agency. However, the ideas are interesting enough
to overshadow this.

If you read Fine Structure, I would recommend not reading the comments until you've
finished the story. Some readers are exceptionally bright and figure out answers
to the story's riddles the chapter they come out, and it's more fun to see how much
you can figure out on your own and let the story reveal itself.

Other stories, by qntm
http://qntm.org/fiction

Sam Hughes has a lot of science fiction short stories on his site, and I like
most of them. He also has some blog posts about different models of time travel
and time in general that are worth reading, under qntm.org/time.

Recommended short stories:
- I don't know, Timmy, being God is a big responsibility
- The Difference
- The Last-But-One Question
- Causal Noose
- Gorge


CROSSOVER (stories based in two or more fandoms. I'll remark on how much I think you need, but usually you only need one of the two to enjoy these stories)

**Fallout Equestria, by kkat (MLP x Fallout)
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/119190/fallout-equestria

Yes, someone did a crossover between cartoon ponies and a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
AND IT'S REALLY GOOD! I know, right? How does that even make sense?

Fallout Equestria bears many similarities to Worm. Littlepip is Taylor, and Taylor
is Littlepip; the number of parallels between the two stories is ridiculous. Both
stories are dark, involve clever use of unconventional talents, and have running themes
of companionship and unintended consequences. Head to head, I actually like Fallout
Equestria over Worm, and I love Worm so, so much. Let's put it this way: the author
made a pool of water one of the scariest encounters of the story.

The first couple of chapters can be tricky to get through - they're gory and graphic,
and they're intended to be that way to emphasize the reaction of the protagonist, but
it also turns some people off the story. Persevere and you'll get to the good stuff.

Good enough to read if you know nothing about MLP or Fallout, but for maximal enjoyment
and emotional heft, know Friendship is Magic up to the middle of Season 2.

**Doctor Whooves Adventures, by Squeak and the Pony in a Box crew (MLP x Doctor Who)
https://ponyinabox.com/shows/doctor-whooves

I'm bending my rules a bit for this one. It's not a written story, it's an audio
play. Honestly, it's hard for me to find something about this show I don't like.
Twilight's a fantastic companion; she's one of the few characters that can keep
up with The Doctor, and gets herself out of trouble almost as often as the Doctor
does. The voice actors are great, the scripts are fantastic, even the art style
for the accompanying pictures are good. The only thing I'm sad about is the update
rate. Speaking of which, Bells of Fate part 2 is coming out in August! OMG OMG
it's been a YEAR since the first part came out and it's finally happening it's
happening.

Ahem. Yes, I like this series a lot. This series singlehandedly brought Doctor
Who from "may watch sometime" to "will watch when I have time" and got me into
Celtic music (Bells of Fate is themed after a cross between Ireland and the Knights
of Camelot.) There's a little continuity, but most episodes
are standalone. Recommended viewing order:

Number 12 Part 1 + 2 (character introduction)
Bells of Fate (yeah I've gushed about this enough)
Rhapsody in Blue Box (requires a little continuity, watch Cell Mates first. SO WORTH IT though, around as good as Bells of Fate)
Wrong Way Backwards Parts 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 (you'll see what I mean. It's very elaborately made.)
Shadows of the Lunar Republic
Chords of Chaos + Pony of the Opera

Harry Potter and the Natural 20 (Harry Potter x D&D)
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20

If you know either Harry Potter or D&D, you'll like this story. The premise is that
a min-maxing Wizard named Milo from the D&D universe is dropped into the Harry Potter
universe. Their systems of magic collide, and hilarity ensues. If you want to see
creative rule-bending, this is a story for you. If you want to see someone
freak out about a Save-or-Die spell with an impossibly high DC check, this is
also for you.

Note that whenever Milo needs to roll a dice, the author actually rolls a dice
in real life, then continues writing based on the result. Milo also has an online
character sheet that gets updated over the story. Unfortunately, the story
is on indefinite hiatus right now.

The Infinite Loops (everything x everything)
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheInfiniteLoops

The Infinite Loops is this strange set of community driven short stories. The
excuse premise is as follows:

- There is a massive multiversal supercomputer called Yggdrasil, which runs
all fictional realities.
- Something is very, very broken in Yggdrasil. As a stopgap measure, the admins
of Yggdrasil have put realities into a safe mode where no new history can happen -
when a universe hits the end of its history (end of current canon), it loops back
to the start of canon.
- The protagonists of some universes are Awake, which means they keep memories
when the loop happens. Those characters are stuck in a Groundhog Day scenario
where time keeps repeating. Secondary characters may or may not be awake in a given
loop.
- Skills carry over between loops, knowledge carries over between loops.
Loopers have a soulbonded extra-dimensional pocket that lets them carry objects
between loops. Pockets start small but grow over time. One of the oldest loopers
has a very nice Death Star collection.
- Different universes can cross over, and characters can start a time loop
in another universe. This is where the stories get fun. You can have a looping
Jean-Luc Picard wake in Lord of the Rings, meet up with a looping Bilbo Baggins,
and together they can troll the hell out of an unawake Gandalf. Or, Mega Man
could loop into the How to Train your Dragon universe, trade tips with Hiccup, and
then bring his dragon riding skills back to the Mega Man universe. Or, someone
may decide to take a break from all the hijinks, and have time looping Anakin
+ time looping Obi-Wan sit down and have a long, emotional discussion about
why things between them ended up so badly the first time through.

Overall, it creates a strangely addictive anthology. The time loop framework
is a good foundation for people to try writing crazy crossovers. Bourne Identity x MLP? It
exists. Naruto x Kung Fu Panda? Yep, someone wrote a story based on a shared
love for ramen. Star Trek x World War 2? Yes, crossovers with real history
are allowed too.

I was introduced through the MLP loops. To read those, you should go in
with knowledge up to season 3, or accept that you'll get spoiled. I can't speak
to the quality of the other anthologies. See the crazy big spreadsheet
at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aMlKMJktaql_1dwZ3ksPwFx-_zbuEOxkdy5gPcHkN0w/edit#gid=0
for your own intro point.

HARRY POTTER

Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality
http://hpmor.com/

One of the most infamous works out there. This tends to be love it or hate it,
I'm in the love it camp but entirely understand why people don't like it.

Premise: Petunia Dursley leaves Vernon and marries an Oxford professor. Harry
grows up in a loving household surrounded by books, and spends most of his
childhood reading books about science, meaning physics + chemistry + cognitive
science. Then, he gets a letter from Hogwarts...

The story is pretty pedagogical, since one of the author's main goals is to
bring more awareness to cognitive biases. This is one of the big sticking points.
The pedagogy can get in the way of the writing, which is fine if you're okay
with taking a break to learn about testing the null hypothesis, and annoying
if you're not in the mood. However, that doesn't mean the plot
is bad. There are very funny, very awesome moments. Characters are well
developed and act intelligently - one of the core tenets is that every character
must believe themselves to be correct and justified, even if they are villanous.
