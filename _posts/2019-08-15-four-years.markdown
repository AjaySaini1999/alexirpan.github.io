*Sorta Insightful* turns four years old today! Whether you were here from the
beginning, or just discovered this blog, thanks for reading.

Tradition states that I should write a self-reflective post about blogging. This
won't be the greatest because I've been doing MUMS Puzzle Hunt the past 2 weeks,
but, well, I knew that going in.


Statistics
----------------------------------------------------------------

Word Count
=============================================
Last year, I wrote [24,449 words]({% post_url 2018-08-18-three-years %}).
This year, I wrote **21,878** words.

21878 total  
{% endhighlight %}

In all honesty, I'm surprised it isn't lower. I felt I wasn't spending as much
time blogging this year, and was expecting a much bigger drop in word count than
about 10%.

I wrote 11 posts this year, slightly under my trend of 1 post a month on average.
I'm counting the AlphaStar post as 2 posts, even though both parts were written
and released at the same time.


Time Spent Writing
============================================

Excluding time spent on this post, my time tracker says I've spent **88 hours, 12 minutes**
writing for my blog this year. This is 67% of the time I spent last year, and
contributes to why it felt like I haven't spent much time blogging: I genuinely
haven't!

It remindes me of one of my favorite quotes.

> If I am to speak ten minutes, I need a week for preparation; if fifteen minutes,
> three days; if half an hour; two days; if an hour, I am ready now.

This is attributed to Woodrow Wilson, [but you can read the Quote Investigator
post if you want to see the full attribution story](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/03/01/short-speech/).

The rather frustrating thing about writing is that you spend a lot of time to
make sure others don't spend a lot of time understanding you, and the better
you do this, the easier it is to ignore. Well, that's how life works.

Oh, past me, how wrong you were. I claimed a Gunnerkrigg Court post was
inevitable, but there's a very good chance I never write it.

My interest in Gunnerkrigg Court has cooled down a lot ever since the conclusion
of the Jeanne arc. Don't get me wrong: it's still a great webcomic, and I'll
easily recommend it to everyone. However, the emotional resonance has faded a
lot. A few big events have happened since then, but right now it feels like
the comic is looking for a new overarching mystery to guide the plot. The
chapters afterwards have felt more like aftershocks, rather than a new
overarching mystery, and with it unfolding at Webcomic Time, it's going to
take a while for the new main plot thread to appear.

Again, I do still want to write that post. But I want to write it in the sense
that I like the idea of writing it, which isn't the same as actually writing it.
Let me see if I can explain this...

In one view of decision making, the choices you make are solely dependent on
your mental state, and the environment you're in. For now, let's throw the
environment out. I, at some point, reach a mental state where I think "Gee,
I should write a post about *Gunnerkrigg Court*". But, I'm busy, or have
other posts I want to write first, so I don't. Later on, I somehow re-arrive
at the same mental state where I think "Gee, I should write a post about
*Gunnerkrigg Count*". Unless something has changed in my thinking since then,
my next decision will be the same as before: I'll say I'm busy, or that I
want to write other posts first, and that sends me on the same trajectory
as before.
