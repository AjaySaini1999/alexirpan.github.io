*Sorta Insightful* turns four years old today! Whether you were here from the
beginning, or just discovered this blog, thanks for reading.

Tradition states that I should write a self-reflective post about blogging. This
won't be the greatest because I've been doing MUMS Puzzle Hunt the past 2 weeks,
but, well, I knew that going in.


Statistics
----------------------------------------------------------------

Word Count
=============================================
Last year, I wrote [24,449 words]({% post_url 2018-08-18-three-years %}).
This year, I wrote **21,878** words.

21878 total  
{% endhighlight %}

In all honesty, I'm surprised it isn't lower. I felt I wasn't spending as much
time blogging this year, and was expecting a much bigger drop in word count than
about 10%.

I wrote 11 posts this year, slightly under my trend of 1 post a month on average.
I'm counting the AlphaStar post as 2 posts, even though both parts were written
and released at the same time.

View Counts
====================================================

This only counts view from August 18, 2018 to today, for only posts I've written
this year.

  1,055 2019-07-27-lagrange-multipliers.markdown  
{% endhighlight %}

This is actually noticeably larger than last year, once you remove outliers. I'm
pleasantly surprised that my Neopets post is up there in view count. Here I was,
thinking that people only read my blog for the machine learning content.


Time Spent Writing
============================================

Excluding time spent on this post, my time tracker says I've spent **88 hours, 12 minutes**
writing for my blog this year. This is about 2/3rds of the time I spent last year,
and explains why it felt like I didn't blog as much this year: I genuinely
didn't!

It remindes me of one of my favorite quotes.

> If I am to speak ten minutes, I need a week for preparation; if fifteen minutes,
> three days; if half an hour; two days; if an hour, I am ready now.

This is attributed to Woodrow Wilson, [but you can read the Quote Investigator
post if you want to see the full attribution story](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/03/01/short-speech/).

The rather frustrating thing about writing is that you spend a lot of time to
make sure others don't spend a lot of time understanding you, and the better
you do this, the easier it is to ignore. Well, that's how life works.


Posts in Limbo

Oh, past me, how wrong you were. I claimed a Gunnerkrigg Court post was
inevitable, but there's a very good chance I never write it.

My interest in Gunnerkrigg Court has cooled down a lot ever since the conclusion
of the Jeanne arc. Don't get me wrong: it's still a great webcomic, and I'll
easily recommend it to everyone. However, the emotional resonance has faded a
lot. A few big events have happened since then, but right now it feels like
the comic is looking for a new overarching mystery to guide the plot. The
chapters afterwards have felt more like aftershocks, rather than a new
overarching mystery, and with it unfolding at Webcomic Time, it's going to
take a while for the new main plot thread to appear.

Again, I do still want to write that post. But I want to write it in the sense
that I like the idea of writing it, which isn't the same as actually writing it.
Let me see if I can explain this...

One way to view decision making is that your choices are solely dependent
on your mental state, and the environment you're in. Let's suppose I'm making
a choice about something that barely depends on my environment. I, at some point,
reach a mental state where I think
"Gee,
I should write a post about *Gunnerkrigg Court*". But I'm busy, or have
other posts I want to write instead, so I don't.

Later on, I re-arrive at the same mental state, and have the same thought.
"Gee, I should write a post about
*Gunnerkrigg Count*". Unless something has changed in my thinking since then,
my next decision will be the same as before: I'll say I'm busy, or that I
want to write other posts first. Repeat a few times, and the end result is that
my thought process follows the same cyclic trajectory, and I'll continually
say that I'll write something, without actually doing it, until something
changes to break the loop.

One way is by changing the environment. Deadlines are a good example of this.
Think of it this way: the deadline is part of the environment. Every day, the
deadline gets closer. If you enter a cyclical pattern of thought, then every
time you restart the cycle, the deadline gets closer and closer. That's the
change in the environment. At some point the deadline is close enough that you
either do it, or you drop it. However, this only works if you respect the
deadline, and if it isn't up for negotiation.

The harder way is to simply decide to change your behavior in a way that breaks
the loop. Obviously doable, and obviously difficult.

In my case, that means...well, that I'm not writing the post yet. But, I'll
formally add it to my list of post ideas that I'd like to write, and maybe
that'll act like the forcing function I need.


Upcoming Posts
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a bad relationship with TODO lists, in the same way that I have a bad
relationship with Pomodoros and other tricks that people I know swear by.
However, I'm going to try them, just this once.

Here's a summary of posts I've considered writing recently.


| Post Subject | Why I Want to Write It | Estimated Time to Complete | Odds I Decide to Write It |
| A post about measurement. Not at the level of "how is a meter defined", although I do like that discussion. I'm more interested in explaining that measurements are inherently imperfect pictures of the underlying reality, an approximation leveraged when it's hard to know the truth. This would then lead into why understanding this is important for understanding how statistics can be misleading, why science can be tricky to reproduce, and why it's critical to understanding the limitations of machine learning and why ML practioners should be very careful when interacting with the real world.

Why I want to Write It: It's a very useful mental concept for understanding
how you can be wrong, despite having lots of data. It's something that experienced
ML people deeply understand, but most ML courses don't try to explain it, instead
letting people discover it for themselves. As machine learning gets applied to
more of society, it is crucially important for people to become ML-literate.
Not at the level of understanding the math behind ML, but at the level of
understanding when it'd be a bad idea to blindly apply machine learning.

Estimated Time to Complete: Very high. I've thought about this a while, and want
to explain it right, but explaining it right will require a lot of careful thought.

Odds I Do Eventually Write This: Almost Certain (95%+)


A post about Gunnerkrigg Court. What it does well, why I find its story fun,
and why you should read it.

Why I Want to Write It: Gunnerkrigg Court is up there as one of my favorite
webcomics of all time, and although I have a short blurb about it on my
Webcomics Recommendation page, I've felt I have more to say about it than
just that blurb suggests.

Estimated Time to Complete: Medium-High

Odds I Eventually Write This: Reasonable (75%+)


A post about attending BronyCon 2019, and my thoughts on what My Little Pony means
to me and the community that grew around it, along with what I've learned about
how the world works.

Why I Want to Write It: I've been meaning to write a post about My Little Pony
for a while, but had trouble even starting to get thoughts down. It was too big
for me to explain. I think I can use BronyCon 2019 as a lens to focus thoughts
into more specific ideas, and if I have unused material I can make follow-on
posts later on.

Estimated Time to Complete: High. Will likely involve lots of introspecting,
and figuring out the right phrasings for implicit concepts that I haven't
put into words before.

Odds I Eventually Write This: High (85%+)


A post about the history of Dominion Online, and the many trials it's been
through. This is the same post I mentioned in a previous post.

Why I want to Write It: I've been part of the competitive Dominion community for
many years, and as someone who lived through a lot of the drama, I'm realizing
that the list of people who've seen everything Dominion's gone through drops
every day. I would rather these stories not be forgotten.

Estimated Time to Complete: Very high. I know exactly what I want to say, the
time comes from having to look up sources for everything, and the sheer length
of what I want to write.

Odds I Eventually Finish This: High (85%+)
