Life is really unpredictable.

You know the cliche interview question, "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"?
If you has asked me that 5 years ago, I wouldn't know what to say. But I certainly
wouldn't be saying that I'd write a post gushing about a MLP x Doctor Who fan series.

The Short MLP Primer
----------------------------------

My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is a cartoon about pastel colored horses living
lives with other pastel colored horses.

The main horse (okay, pony) is Twilight
Sparkle, a unicorn prodigy who's incredibly smart and hard working. However,
she's also a bit socially inept, and prone to worrying about everything too much.

It's surprisingly good. Although it takes a while to warm up to it, once you like the
characters the show just clicks and becomes a joy to watch.
The show starts with Twilight saving the world from eternal darkness, then shifts to
slice of life.
Occasionally, it shifts back to adventure, where they have to fight monsters
that escaped Tartarus, or overthrow communistic cults, or save kingdoms from
totalitarian dictators. Yes, really, that's all happened before.

As for the fandom, the MLP fandom is one of the craziest and most prolific
fandoms in the world, and I proudly count myself among them.


The Short Doctor Who Primer
----------------------------------

So. I actually have not watched a single episode of Doctor Who.
Everything I know about the show is from osmosis through the Internet. I'll do the
best that I can, and I apologize in advance for any
Doctor Who misrepresentation. Meaning, please don't kill me Whovians.)

Doctor Who is a long running show by the BBC. I do mean long; the show celebrated
its 50th anniversary recently.

The eponymous Doctor is a Time Lord who time travels in the TARDIS, which looks
like a police call box. Although he looks human, he's somewhere around 1000 years old.
Whenever he dies, he regenerates into a new form (which is the In-Universe explanation
for why he can be played by several different actors, and why his personality
changes for each incarnation.)
Together with a companion (a human who's in on the Doctor's secret), he travels
through time and space, fighting monsters like the Daleks or the Weeping Angels,
or alternatively helping resolve any local trouble he runs into. Most likely,
he's doing both at the same time, all while he's either a little too insane
or not insane enough.


So....Why Are There MLP x Doctor Who Crossovers?
----------------------------------

In the early days of the MLP fandom (around the middle of Season 1), people
noticed that one of the background ponies had similar hair to David Tennant's,
the then current Doctors actor. Additionally, he had a cutie mark of an hourglass.
(A cutie mark is a symbol that appears when a pony finds their special talent. It's
the rough analogue of puberty/adolescence.)

(two pictures)

When you take a pony that looks like the Doctor, and suggest his special talent
is related to time, there's only one reasonable conclusion.
Fans quickly christened him as "Doctor Whooves" and produced a ridiculous amount
of fanart and crossover fanfic. Some tries to explain how the Doctor ended up in
Equestria, and others decide to recreate memes, like the Doctor hating pairs (LINK)
and saying "Allonsy" all the time (LINK).
To this day, he's one of the most popular fan characters.


The Adventure Begins
---------------------------

Among all those fanfics was one titled "Number 12", by SqueakAnon. (The name
is accurate. SqueakAnon is pretty secretive. People don't even know Squeak's gender.)
Squeak's take was that Doctor Whooves was the twelfth regeneration of the Doctor (the show
was on the 11th at the moment). The story starts with the TARDIS crashing into
Twilight's house and picks up from there.
a house as the Doctor is fleeing for his life and picks up from there.

A while later, Sqeuak decided to take it one step further. He or she contacted other
members of the fandom and formed a group called Pony In
A Box Productions. From the start point of "Number 12", they plotted out a season
of content, and started uploading radio plays under the title "Doctor Whooves Adventures".

And now we come to *me*. Around two years ago, I found out about the series, and
decided to listen to a few episodes. At first, it was just entertaining, but at
some point I realized Pony in a Box has stolen my heart, locked it away and threw away
the key, and I didn't even care. I love this series so, so much. I actually find
it difficult to find things I don't like about the radio play. The characters
are well done, the soundtrack fits well, even the static image on the Youtube
uploads are good. Doctor Whooves Adventures is in my favorite works of all time list
and singlehandedly convinced me to watch Doctor Who, as soon as I find time for the
binge.


Why Should You Watch This Show?
--------------------------------
It's funny when it wants to be, but isn't afraid to be sad.
The characters are not only well written but well acted. It mixes the two canons
well: the overarching themes of death and loss from Doctor Who are tempered
by themes of optimism and inherent goodness from MLP. Yet despite taking elements
from both, Doctor Whooves Adventures is approachable to people outside
either fandom, and you don't need to know either MLP or Doctor Who to
enjoy this series. This audio play isn't good because it uses MLP or Doctor Who;
it's good because it's good in its own right.

Below, I'm going to repeat the above, but in many, many more words. Let's get to it!


Production Values
-----------------------------

Normally, you don't expect fan creations to go through much production, which
makes the effort put into Doctor Whooves Adventures all the more surprising.
The group at Pony In A Box holds
themselves to a professional standard, and it shows. First,
the writing staff (led by Squeak) prepares a script. Then, the voice actors
record their lines. At the same time, the art team creates promotional pictures for
the eventual Youtube upload.
Once all the lines are recorded, the sound team comes in, adding background music and
sound effects. (As someone who has done very minor movie editing, this is both
more important and more time consuming than it sounds.)
Every episode is a huge labor of love, and that means lean, concise scripts
and real emotional delivery.
Unfortunately, it also means each episode takes
a long time to finish. To date, I've been waiting for the conclusion to Bells of
Fate (my favorite episode) for over a year. Still, it's coming out soon! Meaning,
they targeted August of this year and it's already September...but it is happening
and I can't begrudge the team too much because I know how long these things can take.
(Some members of Pony in a Box have depression issues too.)


Somehwere in this section, add the Mayhew segment.


The Writing
----------------------------------

The writing for this series is really, really slick. There's lots of deadpan humor,
and characterization is done very efficiently.
The intonation and wording speak volumes without
getting in the way of the plot. Again, I recommended listening to the quote instead of
reading it, since there's a lot you miss if you only read the transcript.

> "So, now that you've got me [in the TARDIS], I've realized this is completely insane."
>
> "I've been at it so long I'd stopped noticing."

And although it never gets too dark, at times it gets heartwrenching.

(Penny Dreadful, or excerpt from Number 12, ending of Bells of Fate?)

Twilight's a fantastic companion; as one of the smartest ponies in MLP canon,
she's probably the only character that can keep up with the Doctor. She
solves problems and gets herself out of trouble almost as often as the Doctor does.
That's another strength of the show: it makes a point of having strong female
characters and a gender balanced cast. (Aside: this is true of most MLP fanwork. When a
fandom grows in open defiance of gender stereotypes, people pay a lot of attention
to portraying gender and sexuality realistically. It's part of what makes the fandom great.)

The greatest strength of the writing is how organically everything feels. In
poorly written stories, it feels like events happen because of some unseen hand
willing things to happen, but in this series, everything happens through characters
playing off each other. Although the setting borrows heavily from MLP, the show is
its own universe, and doesn't rely on pandering to either MLP or Doctor Who to
be entertaining.


Parting Remarks
-----------------------------

If you do decided to listen to the series, I recommend listening in episode order.
However, ther isn't that much continuity between episodes, so if an episode isn't
working for you, here's the episodes order by how much I liked them.

There's a light amount of continuity between episodes,b

- Number 12 Part 1 + 2. You absolutely need to start here, no questions, but I
enjoy later episodes more.
- Bells of Fate. My favorite episode. Great mythology influences, and the parallel
plots tie together elegantly.
- Rhapsody in Blue Box. Watch the short Cell Mates first. Tugs at the heartstrings more
than any other.
- Wrong Way Backwards Parts 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3. You'll see what I mean. Very
wibbly wobbly. In construction it is the most impressive, but it's also quite long.

The remaining episodes (Shadows of the Lunar Republic, Chords of Chaos,
Pony of the Opera) are fun, but not as strong as the rest.

Maybe my love for this series will fade. (But it's hard to see that happening.)

Maybe Doctor Whooves Adventures will die a slow death, as the creators lose interest.
(But I hope that never comes to pass.)

The only thing I'm certain about is that I'm not certain about how my preferences
will shift, and to stay open to change. To keep reaching. Do you see the light in
the night sky? There! Out, way up high...

Sorry, that got a sidetracked.
I suppose in the end, I love a good story, that romanticism leaks out, and I turn
flowery and pretentious.

Until next time. In the words of the good Doctor himself,

> "Onwards and upwards!"
