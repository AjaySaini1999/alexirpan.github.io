Life is really unpredictable.

You know the cliche interview question, "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"?
If you has asked me that 5 years ago, I wouldn't know what to say. But I certainly
wouldn't be saying that I'd write a post gushing about a MLP x Doctor Who fan series.

The Short MLP Primer
----------------------------------

My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is a cartoon about pastel colored horses.

It's surprisingly good. Nice characters, fun jokes, lots of pony puns,
and real development.
Usually plots are slice of life stories, but sometimes the Mane 6 (yes that is
their offcial name) run afoul of
dragons, manticores, and hydras, forcing them to save the world.

This cartoon spawned one of the craziest fandoms in the world, and I'm proudly
a member.


The Short Doctor Who Primer
----------------------------------

Doctor Who is a long running show by the BBC. The show celebrated its 50th
anniversary recently.

The eponymous Doctor is a time lord who time travels in a police call box called the TARDiS.
His age isn't very exact, but it's somewhere over 1000 years old.
He travels time and space with a companion, who acts as the audience surrogate
to let the Doctor explain what's going on this episode. Whenever the Doctor is
about to die, he regenerates into a new form and personality (which is the in-universe
explanation for whenever the actor changes.)

This show is a British institution, and I have not watched a single episode. All
my knowledge is from secondhand leakage through crossovers.


So....Why Are There MLP x Doctor Who Crossovers?
----------------------------------

Let's go back to the early days of the MLP fandom. It's 2011, sometime between
Season 1 and Season 2. Fan communities are growing, people are using the word
*brony* as a label for themselves, et cetera. Around then, someone notices
one of the background characters looks a lot like a ponified David Tennant.
And, he has an hourglass as a cutie mark. (Short aside: a cutie mark is a symbol
that magically appears on ponies when they've discovered their special talent.)


(two pictures)

So, here's a pony who looks like the 10th incarnation of the Doctor, and his special
talent is TIME? Fan artists, go! Fanfic writers, go! Bronies immediately called
him Doctor Whooves because yes, we add pony puns to literally anything.


Doctor Whooves Adventures
---------------------------

Somewhere along the way (check date), one writer in particular (SqueakAnon, very secretive, don't
even know his or her gender) decided to go one step further.
Squeak, along with other members of the fandom, formed a group called Pony In
A Box Productions, and started planning out an audio play called Doctor Whooves
Adventures.

Several years later, I started listening to the series, and they stole my heart.

Production Values
----------------------------------

For a fan series that people make in their own time, the show has astoundingly
high production values. The voice actors know who their characters are and know
how they want to portray them. The sound team picks songs that match well and
include good sound effects, which is a lot harder than it sounds. I wouldn't like
this series nearly as much without hearing all the nuances that go into the scripts.

The Writing
----------------------------------

Squeak writes good scripts. Pony In A Box
has other productions, most of which are written by Squeak, and I like those for similar
reasons. He or she has a dry, subtle sense of humor, and simple conversations reveal
so many details about the characters. Some samples:

From Daring Do Adventures (she's the pony version of Indiana Jones)

> "I'm fairly sure that's going to come back to haunt us."
>
> "Eh, we'll cross that burnt bridge once we get there."

From Tales Of A Junk Town Pony Peddler (set in post-apocalpytic wasteland)

> "Girl, you don't have a lick of street smarts about you (CHECK ACTUAL)
> 
> "Streetwise? Streetwise?! If *that's* what it means to be streetwise,
> I'll stay on the sidewalk, thanks! Show some compassion for once!

From Doctor Whooves Adventures

> "So, now that you've got me [in the TARDIS], I've realized this is completely insane."
>
> "I've been at it so long I'd stopped noticing."

However, the scripts truly shine when the voice actors get to say their lines for
real. The delivery is very well done - the voice actors know who their characters are
and how they want to portray them. Reading the script by itself is actually quite
dull, written transcripts don't do a good job of showing what the final product is
like. (See the [script for Dark Knight](http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~ina22/splaylib/Screenplay-Dark_Knight.HTM).
It reads well, but only because of the small notes that guide the scenery you imagine.)

The Characters
------------------------------------

Only two characters

I'm bending my rules a bit for this one. It's not a written story, it's an audio
play. Honestly, it's hard for me to find something about this show I don't like.
Twilight's a fantastic companion; she's one of the few characters that can keep
up with The Doctor, and gets herself out of trouble almost as often as the Doctor
does. The voice actors are great, the scripts are fantastic, even the art style
for the accompanying pictures are good. The only thing I'm sad about is the update
rate. Speaking of which, Bells of Fate part 2 is coming out in August! OMG OMG
it's been a YEAR since the first part came out and it's finally happening it's
happening.

Ahem. Yes, I like this series a lot. This series singlehandedly brought Doctor
Who from "may watch sometime" to "will watch when I have time" and got me into
Celtic music (Bells of Fate is themed after a cross between Ireland and the Knights
of Camelot.) There's a little continuity, but most episodes
are standalone. Recommended viewing order:

Number 12 Part 1 + 2 (character introduction)
Bells of Fate (yeah I've gushed about this enough)
Rhapsody in Blue Box (requires a little continuity, watch Cell Mates first. SO WORTH IT though, around as good as Bells of Fate)
Wrong Way Backwards Parts 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 (you'll see what I mean. It's very elaborately made.)
Shadows of the Lunar Republic
Chords of Chaos + Pony of the Opera
