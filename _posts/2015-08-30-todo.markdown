Life is really unpredictable.

You know the cliche interview question, "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"?
If you has asked me that 5 years ago, I wouldn't know what to say. But I certainly
wouldn't be saying that I'd write a post gushing about a MLP x Doctor Who fan series.

The Short MLP Primer
----------------------------------

My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is a cartoon about pastel colored horses living
lives with other pastel colored horses.

The main horse (okay, pony) is Twilight
Sparkle, a unicorn prodigy who's incredibly smart and hard working. However,
she's also a bit socially inept, and prone to worrying about everything too much.

It's surprisingly good. Characters are well defined and undergo real
development, and although it takes a while to warm up to it, once you like the
characters the show just clicks and becomes a joy to watch.
The show starts with Twilight saving the world from eternal darkness, then shifts to
slice of life.
Occasionally, it shifts back to adventure, where they have to fight monsters
that escaped Tartarus, or overthrow communistic cults, or save kingdoms from
totalitarian dictators. Yes, really.

As for the fandom, the MLP fandom is one of the craziest and most prolific
fandoms in the world, and I proudly count myself among them.


The Short Doctor Who Primer
----------------------------------

(I have not watched a single episode of Doctor Who proper. Everything I know is
from internet fueled osmosis, and I apologize in advance for any
Doctor Who misrepresentation. Meaning, please don't kill me Whovians.)

Doctor Who is a long running show by the BBC. I do mean long; the show celebrated
its 50th anniversary recently.

The eponymous Doctor is a Time Lord who time travels in the TARDIS, which looks
like a police call box. Although he looks human, he's somewhere around 1000 years old.
Whenever he dies, he regenerates into a new form (which is the In-Universe explanation
for why he can be played by several different actors, and why his personality
changes for each incarnation.)
Together with a companion (a human who's in on the Doctor's secret), he travels
through time and space, fighting monsters like the Daleks or the Weeping Angels,
or alternatively helping resolve any local trouble he runs into. Most likely,
he's doing both at the same time, all while he's either a little too insane
or not insane enough.


So....Why Are There MLP x Doctor Who Crossovers?
----------------------------------

In the early days of the MLP fandom (around the middle of Season 1), people
noticed that one of the background ponies had similar hair to David Tennant's,
the then current Doctors actor. Additionally, he had a cutie mark of an hourglass.
(A cutie mark is a symbol that appears when a pony finds their special talent. It's
the rough analogue of puberty/adolescence.)

(two pictures)

When you take a pony that looks like the Doctor, and suggest his special talent
is related to time, there's only one reasonable conclusion.
Fans quickly christened him as "Doctor Whooves" and produced a ridiculous amount
of fanart and crossover fanfic. Some tries to explain how the Doctor ended up in
Equestria, and others decide to recreate memes, like the Doctor hating pairs (LINK)
and saying "Allonsy" all the time (LINK).
To this day, he's one of the most popular fan characters.


The Adventure Begins
---------------------------

Among all those fanfics was one titled "Number 12", by SqueakAnon. (The name
is accurate. SqueakAnon is pretty secretive. People don't even know Squeak's gender.)
Squeak's take was that Doctor Whooves was the twelfth regeneration of the Doctor (the show
was on the 11th at the moment). The story starts with the TARDIS crashing into
Twilight's house and picks up from there.
a house as the Doctor is fleeing for his life and picks up from there.

A while later, Sqeuak decided to take it one step further. He or she contacted other
members of the fandom and formed a group called Pony In
A Box Productions. From the start point of "Number 12", they plotted out a season
of content, and started uploading radio plays under the title "Doctor Whooves Adventures".

And now we come to *me*. Around two years ago, I found out about the series, and
decided to listen to a few episodes. At first, it was just entertaining, but at
some point I realized Pony in a Box has stolen my heart, locked it away and threw away
the key, and I didn't even care. I love this series so, so much. I actually find
it difficult to find things I don't like about the radio play. The characters
are well done, the soundtrack fits well, even the static image on the Youtube
uploads are good. Doctor Whooves Adventures is in my favorite works of all time list
and singlehandedly convinced me to watch Doctor Who, as soon as I find time for the
binge.


Why Should You Watch This Show?
--------------------------------
It's funny when it feels like it but isn't afraid to be sad.
The characters are not only well written but well acted. It mixes the two canons
well: the overarching themes of death and loss from Doctor Who are tempered
by themes of optimisim and conviction from MLP. Yet despite taking elements
from both, Doctor Whooves Adventures is approachable to people outside
either fandom, and you don't need to know either MLP or Doctor Who to
enjoy this series.

Below, I'm going to repeat the above, but in many, many more words. Let's get to it!


Production Values
-----------------------------

Normally, you don't expect fan creations to go through much production, which
makes the effort put into Doctor Whooves Adventures all the more surprising.
The group at Pony In A Box holds
themselves to a professional standard, and it shows. First,
the writing staff (led by Squeak) prepares a script. Then, the voice actors
record their lines. At the same time, the art team creates promotional pictures for
the eventual Youtube upload.
Once all the lines are recorded, the sound team comes in, adding background music and
sound effects. (As someone who has done very minor movie editing, this is both
more important and more time consuming than it sounds.)
Every episode is a huge labor of love, and that means lean, concise scripts
and real emotional delivery.
Unfortunately, it also means each episode takes
a long time to finish. To date, I've been waiting for the conclusion to Bells of
Fate (my favorite episode) for over a year. Still, it's coming out soon! Meaning,
they targeted August of this year and it's already September...but it is happening
and I can't begrudge the team too much because I know how long these things can take.
(Some members of Pony in a Box have depression issues too.)



Why should people watch this show?
- Production values put into the show make it feel like profesisonal quality
- The show uses lots of dry, deadpan humor
- At the same time, the show isn't afraid to delve into loss, death, the consequences
of actions. Possible segueway into the show being more Doctor Who like?
- Characters are acted very well (ties into first point.) Show makes a point of
having strong female characters. Talk about Twilight actually keeping up with
the Doctor and getting herself out of trouble as often as the Doctor rescuing here.
- Overall, it strikes a nice balance between the darker Doctor Who mythos and
the lighter elements of MLP.
- (Also the crossover has brilliant construction, OMG.)

The Writing
----------------------------------

The writing for this series is really, really slick. Characterization is done
very economically - there are very few lines that are used only to tell the audience
how the characters think. Instead, the intonation and wording speak volumes without
getting in the way of the plot. Again, I recommended listening to the quote instead of
reading it, since there's a lot you miss if you only read the transcript.

> "So, now that you've got me [in the TARDIS], I've realized this is completely insane."
>
> "I've been at it so long I'd stopped noticing."

Twilight's a fantastic companion; she's one of the few characters that can keep
up with The Doctor, and gets herself out of trouble almost as often as the Doctor
does.



Number 12 Part 1 + 2 (character introduction)
Bells of Fate (yeah I've gushed about this enough)
Rhapsody in Blue Box (requires a little continuity, watch Cell Mates first. SO WORTH IT though, around as good as Bells of Fate)
Wrong Way Backwards Parts 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 (you'll see what I mean. It's very elaborately made.)
Shadows of the Lunar Republic
Chords of Chaos + Pony of the Opera
