Life is really unpredictable.

You know the cliche interview question, "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"?
If you has asked me that 5 years ago, I wouldn't know what to say. But I certainly
wouldn't be saying that I'd write a post gushing about a MLP x Doctor Who fan series.

The Short MLP Primer
----------------------------------

My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is a cartoon about pastel colored horses doing
things with other pastel colored horses.

It's surprisingly good. The characters are well defined and undergo real
development, the jokes are pretty good, and the plots are both realistic and
relatable.
The episodes are usually slice of life stories with faint continuity,
but occasionally they have adventures inspired by Greek mythology
where they fight monsters that escaped Tartarus or overthrow totalitarian
dictators. Yes, really.

The MLP fandom is one of the craziest and most prolific fandoms in the world,
and I proudly count myself among them.


The Short Doctor Who Primer
----------------------------------

Doctor Who is a long running show by the BBC. I do mean long; the show celebrated
its 50th anniversary recently.

The eponymous Doctor is a Time Lord who time travels in the TARDIS, which looks
like a police call box. Although he looks human, he's somewhere over 1000 years old.
Whenever he dies, he regenerates into a new form (which is the In-Universe explanation
for why he can be played by several different actors.)
Together with a companion (a human who's in on the Doctor's secret), he travels
through time and space, helping resolve any conflicts he finds along the way.

I have not watched a single episode of Doctor Who proper. Everything I know is from
crossovers and internet fueled osmosis, so I apologize in advance for any
Doctor Who misrepresentation.


So....Why Are There MLP x Doctor Who Crossovers?
----------------------------------

Let's go back to the early days of the MLP fandom. It's 2011, sometime between
Season 1 and Season 2. Fan communities are growing, people are using the word
*brony* as a label for themselves, et cetera. Around then, someone notices
one of the background characters looks a lot like a ponified David Tennant.
And, he has an hourglass as a cutie mark. (Short aside: a cutie mark is a symbol
that magically appears on ponies when they've discovered their special talent.)


(two pictures)

So, here's a pony who looks like the 10th incarnation of the Doctor, and his special
talent is TIME? Fan artists, go! Fanfic writers, go! Bronies immediately called
him Doctor Whooves because yes, we add pony puns to literally anything.


Doctor Whooves Adventures
---------------------------

Somewhere along the way (check date), one writer in particular (SqueakAnon, very secretive, don't
even know his or her gender) decided to go one step further.
Squeak, along with other members of the fandom, formed a group called Pony In
A Box Productions, and started planning out an audio play called Doctor Whooves
Adventures.

Several years later, I listened to the series, and it stole my heart. It's
genuinunely in my favorite works of all time list. It's singlehandly convinced
me to watch Doctor Who proper, as soon as I can figure out a good time to deal with
the binge.

Part of the reason I love the audio series so much is the shockingly high
production values, which you normally don't expect out of fanwork.
Although the audio play is a side project, the group at Pony In A Box holds
themselves to the same standards as a professional company, and it shows. First,
the writing staff (led mostly by Squeak) prepares a script. Then, the voice actors
record their lines. At the same time, the art team creates promotional pictures for
the eventual Youtube upload.
Once all the lines are recorded, the sound team comes in, adding background music and
sound effects. (This is both more important and more time consuming than it sounds.)

Overall, every episode is a huge labor of love. The voice actors don't phone it in,
and the scripts are lean and concise. Unfortunately, it also means each episode takes
a long time to finish. To date, I've been waiting for the conclusion to Bells of
Fate (my favorite episode) for over a year. Still, it's coming out soon! Meaning,
they targeted August of this year and it's already September, but beggars can't
be choosers and all that.



Every script goes through heavy editing, then the voice actors say their lines,
then the sound team adds sound effects and background music, and
high production values. The voice actors know who their characters are and know
how they want to portray them. The sound team picks songs that match well and
include good sound effects, which is a lot harder than it sounds. I wouldn't like
this series nearly as much without hearing all the nuances that go into the scripts.

Why should people watch this show?
- Production values put into the show make it feel like profesisonal quality
- The show uses lots of dry, deadpan humor
- At the same time, the show isn't afraid to delve into loss, death, the consequences
of actions. Possible segueway into the show being more Doctor Who like?
- Characters are acted very well (ties into first point.) Show makes a point of
having strong female characters. Talk about Twilight actually keeping up with
the Doctor and getting herself out of trouble as often as the Doctor rescuing here.
- Overall, it strikes a nice balance between the darker Doctor Who mythos and
the lighter elements of MLP.
- (Also the crossover has brilliant construction, OMG.)

The Writing
----------------------------------

Squeak writes good scripts. Pony In A Box
has other productions, most of which are written by Squeak, and I like those for similar
reasons. He or she has a dry, subtle sense of humor, and simple conversations reveal
so many details about the characters.

> "So, now that you've got me [in the TARDIS], I've realized this is completely insane."
>
> "I've been at it so long I'd stopped noticing."

However, the scripts truly shine when the voice actors get to say their lines for
real. The delivery is very well done - the voice actors know who their characters are
and how they want to portray them. Reading the script by itself is actually quite
dull, written transcripts don't do a good job of showing what the final product is
like. (See the [script for Dark Knight](http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~ina22/splaylib/Screenplay-Dark_Knight.HTM).
It reads well, but only because of the small notes that guide the scenery you imagine.)

The Characters
------------------------------------

The characters in this series are...well, for lack of a better word, alive. Most
credit goes to the voice acting staff, because they clearly have lots of fun with
the script, and most characterization comes from the intonation rather than the content.
Usually, each episode revolves around whoever lives where the TARDIS ends up. Then,
the Doctor and Twilight get in trouble, do various silly and serious things, and
eventually solve the problem.

This sets up an interesting dynamic - the bulk of each episode is about
exploring themes of loss and consequence through examining the connections between
the episodic characters. As for the Doctor and Twilight, their characterization
comes in bits and pieces over the series. (WHERE AM I GOING WITH THIS?)

I'm bending my rules a bit for this one. It's not a written story, it's an audio
play. Honestly, it's hard for me to find something about this show I don't like.
Twilight's a fantastic companion; she's one of the few characters that can keep
up with The Doctor, and gets herself out of trouble almost as often as the Doctor
does. The voice actors are great, the scripts are fantastic, even the art style
for the accompanying pictures are good. The only thing I'm sad about is the update
rate. Speaking of which, Bells of Fate part 2 is coming out in August! OMG OMG
it's been a YEAR since the first part came out and it's finally happening it's
happening.

Ahem. Yes, I like this series a lot. This series singlehandedly brought Doctor
Who from "may watch sometime" to "will watch when I have time" and got me into
Celtic music (Bells of Fate is themed after a cross between Ireland and the Knights
of Camelot.) There's a little continuity, but most episodes
are standalone. Recommended viewing order:
