I've been playing Pokemon Go recently. Not as much as other people, but enough
to see what the game has to offer.

If you haven't been trying the newest craze, here's a quick rundown.

* You play as a Pokemon trainer. Your goal is to catch Pokemon.
* To find Pokemon, you have to go outside. Pokemon spawn randomly, but rumors
say they spawn based on cell tower usage.
* To catch Pokemon, you need to visit Pokestops. These are landmarks scattered
across the world. Visting them gives you items.
* Some landmarks are gyms. These are controlled by other players. At level 5,
each player declares themselves to be team Mystic, team Valor, or team
Instinct. Your goal is to take down gyms owned by other teams, and train gyms
own by your own team. Owning gyms gives you some game rewards, but it's really
more for team pride.

I'm part of Team Instinct. Our reputation...isn't that great.

In my region, Mystic has the most members, Valor is second, and Instinct is
third. I have a few gyms in walking distance, but they're perpetually blue,
guarded by five Mystic players with several 2000+ CP Pokemon. They're out of
my league and it's a little sad.

However, on exactly one occasion the gym near my house has been held by
Team Instinct. For about two days, it was level 7, with the weakest Pokemon
at 2000 CP and the strongest at almost 3000 CP.

It's since been whittled down and turned back into a Mystic gym, but that
Instinct gym is still the strongest gym I've ever seen. Why?

To explain it, I'm going to jump back to a more serious turf war: World War
2.
