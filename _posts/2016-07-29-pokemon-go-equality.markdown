I've been playing Pokemon Go recently. If you haven't played the game, here's
all you need to know for this post.

* You play as a Pokemon trainer. Your goal is to catch Pokemon. Doing so
increases your level, which increases the Combat Power (CP) of wild Pokemon.
* At level 5, players declare themselves as Team Mystic, Team Valor, or
Team Instinct, which are blue, red, and yellow respectively.
* Your goal is to claim gyms for your team and defend them from enemy
teams. Gyms are real world landmarks that you can claim once you're within
range of them. Once claimed, players can either train gyms their team owns
(to make them harder to defeat) or fight enemy gyms (to make them weaker.)
Both are easier if your Pokemon have higher CP.

In my region, Mystic has the most members, Valor is second, and Instinct
is last. I chose Team Instinct, and our reputation for team strength...
isn't that great.

There are a few gyms in walking distance of where I live, but they're
perpetually blue. My strongest Pokemon is a 800 CP Arcanine, and when
the gym is guarded by a 1700 CP Vaporeon, there's no point even trying.

However, for just over one day, the gym near my house was held by Team
Instinct. It was level 5, with the weakest Pokemon at 2000 CP and the strongest
being a 2700 CP Snorlax. It didn't last, but for that day I had hope, that
Team Instinct had a shot after all.

That Instinct gym is still the strongest I've ever seen. And in fact this makes
sense, once you account for survivorship bias.

To explain survivorship bias, I'm jumping back to a more serious turf
war: World War 2.

The United States was interested in minimizing planes lost during bombing
runs. To that end, they hired several academics to study aircraft flown
in previous missions. They identified the regions with the most damage,
and recommended to add armor to those aras.

Then, the statistician Abraham Wald had a moment of insight.
The aircraft studied were aircraft that survived in previous missions.
That meant the damaged areas were actually the *least* important
part of the aircraft, because the pilot was able to land safely.
The best places to add armor were actually the places with no damage.

In short, because the population of aircraft was conditioned on survival,
the study overlooked the failure cases.

The application to Pokemon Go is straightforward. The average player in
each team is the same strength, because team choice is pretty arbitrary.
A gym can be attacked by the two teams that don't own it. Therefore, the
team with the fewest members (Team Instinct) faces the most adversity.
So, *given* that I observe a Team Instinct gym that lasts for more than a day,
it has be stronger than a Mystic gym that lasts for more than a day.

Pokemon Go is a silly example, but survivorship bias applies to many serious
situations too.
Let's suppose you're Hispanic and work in the software industry.
Hispanics are underrepresented in tech. If a company is implicitly biased
against Hispanics in their hiring process, then the average Hispanic programmer
will outperform other programmers at that company, because the observation of
their ability is biased towards Hispanics who survive a tougher hiring
process.

This isn't a new idea. Paul Graham [wrote an essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/bias.html)
on the exact same point.
What makes this argument nice is that it applies no matter what the population
looks like. A company with few female engineers can claim there's a pipeline
problem, and there aren't enough female engineers in the workforce.
But if their female engineers consistently outperform their male engineers,
there aren't many counterarguments to claims of bias. To quote the essay
linked,

> This is not just a heuristic for detecting bias. It's what bias means.

(For the record, I have no position on whether there is a pipeline problem.
I haven't researched it enough to have any confidence.)

Now, to be fair, there are a ton of confounding factors.
In Pokemon Go, Mystic gyms have fewer attackers. So, although they don't have
to be strong to last longer, they're also easier to make stronger. Mystic gyms
can be strong, but Instinct gyms have to be strong.

In real world scenarios, there are also positive feedback loops. People from
wealthier backgrounds have an easier time
There are also network effects
which pushes them to be stronger. It's plausible that similar network effects
hold in real life, where people have an easier time getting support from people
like them.
