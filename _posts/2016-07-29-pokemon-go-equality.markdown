I've been playing Pokemon Go recently. Not as much as other people, but enough
to see what the game has to offer.

If you haven't been trying the newest craze, here's a quick rundown.

* You play as a Pokemon trainer. Your goal is to catch Pokemon.
* To find Pokemon, you have to go outside. Pokemon spawn randomly, but rumors
say they spawn based on cell tower usage.
* To catch Pokemon, you need to visit Pokestops. These are landmarks scattered
across the world. Visting them gives you items.
* Some landmarks are gyms. These are controlled by other players. At level 5,
each player declares themselves to be team Mystic, team Valor, or team
Instinct. Your goal is to take down gyms owned by other teams, and train gyms
own by your own team. Owning gyms gives you some game rewards, but it's really
more for team pride.

I'm part of Team Instinct. Our reputation...isn't that great.

In my region, Mystic has the most members, Valor is second, and Instinct is
third. I have a few gyms in walking distance, but they're perpetually blue,
guarded by five Mystic players with several 2000+ CP Pokemon. They're out of
my league and it's a little sad.

However, on exactly one occasion the gym near my house has been held by
Team Instinct. For about two days, it was level 7, with the weakest Pokemon
at 2000 CP and the strongest at almost 3000 CP.

It's since been whittled down and turned back into a Mystic gym, but that
Instinct gym is still the strongest gym I've ever seen. Why?

\*\*\*

To explain this, we need to jump back to a more serious turf war: World War
2.

The US Air Force was interested in minimizing bomber losses to enemy fire.
To that end, they hired several academics to study damages to the aircraft
from their previous missions and recommend improvements.
Initially, the study recommended adding armor to the areas with the most
damage.

At this point, the statistician Abraham Wald had a moment of insight.
The aircraft they were studying were the aircraft that survived their
bombing runs.
The damaged areas were therefore areas where the bomber
could be damaged and still piloted home, and armor should actually be
added to the areas with the *least* damage.

This is a special case of *survivorship bias*. In the bomber study,
the population of aircraft studied was conditoned on the aircraft making
it home.

The application to Pokemon Go is straightforward. First, offense is much
stronger than defense. This is partly because of game mechanics, but there's
a simpler explanation: a gym can be reinforced only by the team that owns it,
and can be attacked by the two other teams which don't own it.

Let's assume the average
player in each team is the same strength. The Pokemon Go team people choose
is arbitrary (discounting mob effects and so on), and there's no reason
to assume a stronger player will be biased towards a specific team.
Each team can be attacked by both other teams. Therefore, the team with
the fewest members (Team Instinct) can be attacked by the most people.
That means Team Instinct gyms are taken down more often than other teams.
So, *given* that we observe a Team Instinct gym, it's more likely to be
stronger than a Valor gym or Mystic gym, because our observation is
conditioned on the gym existing. Simiarly, we expect the average Valor gym
to be stronger than the average Mystic gym.
