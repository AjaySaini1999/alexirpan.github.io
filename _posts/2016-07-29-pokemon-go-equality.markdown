I've been playing Pokemon Go recently. Not as much as other people, but enough
to see what the game has to offer.

If you haven't been trying the newest craze, here's a quick rundown.

* You play as a Pokemon trainer. Your goal is to catch Pokemon.
* To find Pokemon, you have to go outside. Pokemon spawn randomly, but rumors
say they spawn based on cell tower usage.
* To catch Pokemon, you need to visit Pokestops. These are landmarks scattered
across the world. Visting them gives you items.
* Some landmarks are gyms. These are controlled by other players. At level 5,
each player declares themselves to be team Mystic, team Valor, or team
Instinct. Your goal is to take down gyms owned by other teams, and train gyms
own by your own team. Owning gyms gives you some game rewards, but it's really
more for team pride.
