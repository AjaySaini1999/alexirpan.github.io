I've been playing Pokemon Go recently. If you haven't played the game, here's
all you need to know for this post.

* You play as a Pokemon trainer. Your goal is to catch Pokemon. Doing so
increases your level, which increases the Combat Power (CP) of wild Pokemon.
* At level 5, players declare themselves as Team Mystic, Team Valor, or
Team Instinct, which are blue, red, and yellow respectively.
* Your goal is to claim gyms for your team and defend them from enemy
teams. Gyms are real world landmarks that you can claim once you're within
range of them. Once claimed, players can either train gyms their team owns
(to make them harder to defeat) or fight enemy gyms (to make them weaker.)
Both are easier if your Pokemon have higher CP.

In my region, Mystic has the most members. Valor has the second most, and
Instinct has the least. I chose Team Instinct, because come on,
Zapdos is badass.
Unfortunately, because Instinct has so few members, it's the butt monkey
of many jokes.

There are a few gyms in walking distance of where I live, but they're
perpetually owned by Team Mystic. My strongest Pokemon is a 800 CP Arcanine,
and when the gym is guarded by a 1700 CP Vaporeon, there's no point even trying.

However, on exactly one occasion, the gym near my house was taken over by
Team Instinct, and it was the strongest gym I've ever seen.
Level 6, with the weakest Pokemon at 2000 CP and the strongest
being a 2700 CP Snorlax. Eventually, some Mystic players took it down, but
for just over a day I had hope that Instinct players could make it after all.

Alright. What does any of this have to do with social equality?

To explain myself, I'm going to jump back to a more serious turf
war: World War 2.

The United States was interested in minimizing planes lost during bombing
runs. To that end, they hired several academics to study aircraft flown
in previous missions. They identified the regions with the most damage,
and recommended to add armor to those aras.

Then, the statistician Abraham Wald had a moment of insight.
The aircraft studied were aircraft that survived in previous missions.
That meant the damaged areas were actually the *least* important
part of the aircraft, because the pilot was able to land safely.
The best places to add armor were actually the places with no damage.

In short, because the studied population of aircraft
was conditioned on the planes surviving, the previous group had
overlooked the failure cases. This is generally known as *survivorship bias*.

Now, back to Pokemon Go. Let's assume that team choice doesn't affect the
strength of the player. This is a safe assumption, because the fastest
ways to level up are catching Pokemon, visting Pokestops, and evolving
Pokemon under the effect of a Lucky Egg, and all of these methods are
team independent. Given this, gyms owned by Team Instinct face the most
adversity, because they can be attacked by both Mystic and Valor, the two
largest teams. Instinct gyms face more attackers, and are therefore
taken down very quickly. So, *given* that I observe a Team Instinct gym
that survives for several hours, it must be stronger than a similar Mystic
or Valor gym, or else it wouldn't have lasted long enough for me to observe.
Conclusion: Instinct gyms I see are more likely to be badass.

Applying [anthropic arguments](Phttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle)
to Pokemon Go is all well and good, but survivorship bias applies to serious
issues as well. Take discrimination for example. Say you're Hispanic and
want to work in the software industry. If a company is implicitly biased
against Hispanics in their hiring process, the average Hispanic programmer they
hire will outperform their other hires, because the Hispanics have to survive
a tougher hiring process.

This isn't a new idea. Paul Graham [wrote an essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/bias.html)
on the exact same point, and noted this was a litmus test that people could
check at their own companies.
What makes this argument nice is that it applies no matter what the job
market looks like. If a company doesn't have many female engineers, they can
claim it's a pipeline problem and there aren't enough women in the workforce
for tech.
But, if their female engineers consistently outperform other employees,
they must be biasing in the hiring process. To quote Paul Graham's essay,

> This is not just a heuristic for detecting bias. It's what bias means.

It's incredibly important to keep arguments like this in mind, because they
fly in the face of intuition. If someone says some of the smartest people
they know are black...well, for one, even saying something like that is a red
flag. But also, it could mean that they're only willing to be friends with
those people *because* they're so smart.

To be fair, there are a ton of confounding factors behind these arguments.
In Pokemon Go, although Mystic gyms don't need to be strong to survive, they
often become strong anyway, because fewer people attack them and more people can
train them. In the software industry, there are strong socioeconomic
feedback loops that help perpetuate the current demographic imbalance.
If a company notices that rich employees perform better than poor ones, it
doesn't mean they're prejudiced against rich people.

Survivorship bias is not an end-all argument against all criticism. It's simply
one more thing to note down.
