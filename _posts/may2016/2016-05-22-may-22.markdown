I play a lot of video games. They're fun! Mostly, I play platformers and
puzzle games.

One thing I casually follow is the ideas behind video game design. It's
really interesting to read about. Much like cinematography, there's so
much design that you don't consciously recognize until someone points it out
to you. Good design is both invisible to the common viewer and necessary
for quality, which can make it infuriatingly difficult to understand.
