(Translation of the [PavamƒÅna Mantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brihadaranyaka_Upanishad#Pavam.C4.81na_Mantra))

As a kid, I played a lot of video games. That hasn't really changed since
college.

PUT PICTURES HERE

I also play a lot of board games. Right now, Dominion is the biggest
one, but I've played a smattering of other ones, usually Eurogames.

PICTURE HERE TOO.

From a naive standpoint of time spent, this is a lot of time I could have put
into other things. I used to think of video games as useless time sinks
that I used for entertainment. Now, well, they're still time sinks. But they
definitely weren't useless.

CHECK GRAMMER

First, I should explain my perspective on games, to clarify where I'm coming
from. I promise to get less philosophical by the next section break.

All games take place in their own world.

That world follows certain rules. These are called the rules of the game.
For example, baseball. There are two teams. There are four bases. There is
a pitcher, and a short stop, and home runs and base stealing
and strikes and outs. I don't know all the details because I don't watch
baseball, but these are definitely terms baseball uses.

The concepts in a world are then tied together by rules in that world.
For worlds that come from games, these are the rules of the game.
For example, three strikes and you're out in baseball.

So, games are viewable as a set of rules. These rules define the world.
Winning a game is the same as performing actions that are sanctioned by
the rules such that those actions lead towards an objective.

With that out of the way, I can explain why games were and are important
to me. **The rules of a game are much simpler than the rules of the real world.**
Furthermore, the objective in a game is also much, much simpler than that of
the real world.

This gives me a much better idea of what to do. In the real world, I'm a pretty
quiet person. Put me in a game of Resistance or Mafia, and I'll talk a bunch.
What changed? In Resistance or Mafia, the objectives are very simple: pretend
you aren't a spy/mafia, or find the spies/mafia. The rules of these social
deduction games place heavy constraints on the world, and within those constraints
it is massively easier for me to gauge social behavior and guess at other people's
thought processes.

This then leads into my next point. **When the rules the world follows are simpler,
it's easier to act optimally.**
