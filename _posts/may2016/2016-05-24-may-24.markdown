If it wasn't already clear, I'm a pretty weird dude.

By any measure, I'm both a geek and a nerd.
Now, I'm not sure I need to do this, but just to be safe,
I'm using the definition from the alt-text of this xkcd

XKCD PICTURE

> A geek is someone unusually into something (so you could have computer geeks, baseball geeks, theater geeks, etc) and nerds are (often awkward) science, math, or computer geeks.

If you stick around me long enough, you'll find out I'm one of those people
who are "from the Internet". I'm a big Friendship is Magic fan, meaning
I've read at least two million words of fanfiction and have spent money
buying the comics for the Expanded Universe.

(Yes, MLP has an Expanded Universe. It is completely absurd that there's a
market for this, but I'm a consumer of it, so I understand *why* it exists...)

In high school, I got into the Touhou Project. It's a series of Japanese
video games made by a single person. Somehow, there's an entire Internet
subculture revolving around this. I only follow the music side, but there's
a thriving scene of music remixes that I find objectively good.
The first music album I put on my phone was BEGIERDE DES ZAUBERER, a metal
album by Demetori. They are actually my favorite music group of all time.

Meanwhile, I read a decent number of webcomics, some of which I've bought
merchandise for. I have a Dinosaur Comics T-shirt. And, a Homestuck T-shirt.
I also have a Gunnerkrigg Court T-shirt, a Gunnerkrigg Court whiteboard, a metal
Gunnerkrigg Court coin I received for backing the Legendary Showdown Kickstarter,
and...look, Gunnerkrigg Court is really good, okay? Go read it, it is by
far my favorite webcomic.

The point of all of this is that I'm part of a lot of subcultures, and
I never felt like I had to hide that when growing up. I did for a while, until
I realized that people weren't really judging me.
I openly played Magic: the Gathering in middle school. I admitted to reading
fanfiction in high school, and although my friends gave me shit for it, it was
all in good fun. By the time I hit college I was firmly aiming for the "weird
but kinda interesting" niche.

This is completely at odds with the K-12 education I've heard people complain
about, where they have to deal with bullying and everyone's an asshole.
I'm not saying that my school didn't have these issues, I'm saying that I
was mostly insulated from them and I never had to interact with any of those
problems. **I had the freedom to reveal whatever I wanted
about myself without having to worry about what people thought**. I only realize
how fortunate I was to have such an environment until now. It didn't
matter if there were people who did care, because there were enough people
who *didn't* to make this socially viable.

In contrast, there are people who have to bottle up the weird things about
themselves, not because they don't want to share them, but because they
can't share them without ostracizing themselves. I find that really sad. I'm
not sure how I would have come out in that environment, but I don't think I'd
be as happy or okay with my life as I am.
