If it wasn't already clear, I'm a pretty geeky dude.

Now, I'm not sure I need to do this, but just to be safe,
I'm using the definition from the alt-text of this xkcd

XKCD PICTURE

> A geek is someone unusually into something (so you could have computer geeks, baseball geeks, theater geeks, etc) and nerds are (often awkward) science, math, or computer geeks.

If you stick around me long enough, you'll find out I'm one of those people
who are "from the Internet". I'm a big MLP fan, meaning I've read at least two
million words of fanfiction and have spent money buying the comics for
the Expanded Universe. (Yes, MLP has an Expanded Universe. I know, it's
absurd.)

The first music album I put on my phone was Demetori, a group who makes metal
remixes of Touhou music. (Touhou is a series of Japanese video games made by
ZUN. It has an insane subculture that is almost entirely driven by fans.)
They are actually my favorite band of all time.

Meanwhile, I've also bought merchandise from several webcomics. I have
a Dinosaur Comics T-shirt, a Homestuck T-shirt, a Gunnerkrigg Court T-shirt
and a Gunnerkrigg Court whiteboard and a Gunnerkrigg Court coin I received
for backing a Kickstarter and...look, Gunnerkrigg Court is really good, okay?
Go read it. GO READ IT. Imagine Harry Potter as a comic written by Neil
Geiman.

I never really tried to hide my geekiness growing up. I openly played
Magic: the Gathering in middle school. In high school, I told a friend I was
reading fanfiction, and they gave me some shit for it, but it was all in
good fun. When you grow up in an upper-middle class school district, it
turns out people 
turns out nobody gives a shit.
