Today, I watched a blindfolded man eat and critique Italian beef
sandwiches.

YOUTUBE EMBED

Why did I do this?

\*\*\*
{: .centered }

The first reason is simple. I was bored. My browser was already open to YouTube,
and this video showed up in my recommendations. Make up whatever reason you
want for why Alton Brown showed up in my video recommendations. Who knows.

That's an okay explanation, but I'm not satisfied with it. Why did I choose to
watch YouTube instead of opening a Steam game? Why did I click on that
video instead of any of the other YouTube recommendations? When I think back
on my actions, I assume that I always had a reason for doing it. This is true
even if I don't know why I did something. In that case, it just means my
subconscious influenced me in a certain way, and it's up to me to puzzle
out the pieces.

Let's consider a few hypotheses that might have played into my decision.


The Novelty Hypothesis
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not 100\% sure of this, but I'd guess most people don't spend their time
watching blindfolded food critics eat sandwiches. Just a hunch.

That makes this video special. How often have I seen blindfolded taste testing?
Not very often. From an [exploration-exploitation]({% post_url 2016-05-02-may-2 %})
perspective, that places a ton of value of watching it once. Maybe I am actually
a huge fan of blindfolded taste-testing and didn't know it.

However, by that logic I should be watching every video on YouTube, because
I haven't seen anything quite like it yet. This explanation doesn't
accuately incorporate my prior beliefs.

I agree that novelty played a role in my decision. However, *I must have
already had a prior belief that blindfolded taste testing would be
worth watching,* or else I wouldn't have clicked it.

Luckily, this is easier to explain.


The Nostalgia Hypothesis
------------------------------------------------------------------

This video isn't of any food critic, it's of Alton Brown, host of Good
Eats. I used to watch Good Eats as a kid, because

* It taught the science behind cooking in a way that a kid could
understand
* I got to see Alton Brown cook delicious food. (This phenonmenon is
known as food porn.)

Nostalgia is a very powerful force. My past enjoyment from watching
Good Eats must have made me interested in watching more Alton Brown
videos.

This is satisfying enough for me, but for completeness let's add one
more detail.


The Celebrity Hypothesis
------------------------------------------------------------------

I've watched some of Alton Brown's videos in the past. His first one
was LINK. The second I watched was LINK, where he opens a champagne
bottle with a saber.

Again, these are entertaining videos. And that's the thing. Alton
Brown is, at heart, an entertainer. He's a celebrity in the food world.
I don't want to get into stardom theory, because my memory of it
is fairly hazy, but you could call me a fan of his. The natural
instinct of fandom is to watch everything related to the fandom,
and thus, Alton Brown YouTube videos.

It doesn't matter that I've never been to Chicago, and have no opinions
on Italian beef sandwiches. If Alton Brown is giving a review, I'm going
to find it interesting, because I trust his work to be good.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm hungry. Time to head to a sandwich place.
