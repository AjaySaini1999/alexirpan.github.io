Today, I learned about one of the coolest marketing stunts I've ever seen.

Now, you may or may not know there's a new *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles*
movie coming out. If you didn't know, I don't blame you, because I didn't either.
I never watched *TMNT* as a kid, and this is the sequel to the reboot directed
by Michael Bay. I don't like Michael Bay's films, so it's a double whammy.

Anyways, as part of the promotion, check out [this AirBnB listing](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12885815).

Yes, somewhere in New York, they recreated the Turtle's Lair, and it only costs
$10. They don't let you stay the night, but you get free pizza, and there's an
arcade, and there's a basketball court.

Ten dollars for pizza and an arcade is a pretty good deal, even if you're not
into Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. So obviously, they're all booked.

This is an amazing, amazing marketing stunt. For one, it's cheap enough to
feel like something any fan could afford. And secondly, the internal
decorating is on point. I mean, look at this, it's ridiculous.

Look, this marketing campaign was cool enough that it marginally convinced me
to watch the movie. *Me!* A guy who has no nostalgia about *TMNT*, and who
expects the movie to be terrible.

(Warning: TVTropes link incoming, click at your own risk.)

There's some weird [kayfabe](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe) thing going on, where the listing pretends it's
actually Leonardo talking about the place. They don't explicit say they're
advertising the movie, but it's obvious they are if you read the listing
in full. Maybe that's a marketing trick I don't know? Or at least, maybe
it's how good viral campaigns are made. Things that look too much like
advertising don't go viral. No one wants to look like a corporate stooge
who let advertising hijack them. But, if you hide it just a bit, it doesn't
*feel* like you're giving them exposure even though you are.

(For the record, I am not a marketer, I have read literally nothing
on marketing, do not assume I know what I'm talking about.)

Sometimes, I forget that there are people whose entire job is to figure out
how to social engineer as many people as possible to look at their stuff.
**People literally make a living out of this.**

This is the point where some of you may say, "The market has a demand for
this and these people can supply it." Yes, I get
it, but it's not something I consciously think about. I don't think about
how many artists the art market can support, or how many people are employed
to design new headphones. Any economics I know is subconscious information.

Okay, getting off topic, back to marketing. I actually can't remember the last
time I've seen a marketing stunt so interesting. I think part of it is that
this was hosted on AirBnB. I spend most of my time
around people who know the tech industry, and at times it definitely feels
like a bubble. Not an economic bubble, a social bubble. (It might be
an economic bubble, but I don't trust my judgment here.) Everyone I talk
too knows about Medium, Hacker News, Quora, and Palantir, which are four
random tech industry things that are more obscure than you'd assume if you
live your life in Silicon Valley.

I wouldn't expect a marketing group to know about AirBnB, and even if they
did I wouldn't expect them to figure out a way to use it for advertisement.
I'll have to update my beliefs about this later.
