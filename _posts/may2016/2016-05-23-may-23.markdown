A while back, one of my friends asked why I started blogging.
Amazingly, I've never explictly laid it out, so I figured it
was worth writing about.

First off, I'm blogging because I want to. This is obvious to
the point of vacuosness - of course I wouldn't write blog posts
if I didn't want to. Who would?
Still, that doesn't explain why I have this motivation to write.
After thinking about it, I've ultimately decided I blog for mostly
selfish reasons.

Everything comes back to my perspective on writing. Writing is the process
of turning explicit thoughts into words. Thinking about writing, on the
other hand, is the process of turning implicit thoughts into
explicit thoughts.

My blog isn't very focused. I classify my posts into the
following categories.

* Posts on topics I understand well. These are all technical posts, and are
about problems with known solutions. The post is spent presenting
and framing the solution the right way. Examples are the
garbled circuits post and the efficiently biasing a fair coin post.
* Posts on topics I've been learning about recently. These are things
I don't understand very well yet, and trying to articulate them forces me
to condense my understanding into simpler terms.
* For lack of a better word, discussion posts. These are posts where
I try to present my point of view on a topic. These are the bulk majority
of my posts. They're essentially life observations, me explaining
the way I see the world.

Writing posts on topics I understand well doesn't help my understanding, because
I know them well enough to have most of my feelings be explicit already.
Accordingly, I've written very few of these posts, reserving them for
ideas I find exceptionally cool. Yes, it feels good to teach something new,
but writing a good teaching post takes forever, and I don't have the motivation
to sustain it.

Writing posts on topics I've been learning about, on the other hand, is good
for raising awareness on ideas that I think should be more well known.
At this point, I don't know enough to make a judgment call on whether the idea
is worth researching more, but I do know it's interesting enough that someone
else may want to research it more. These posts are primarily
signal boosts of the idea.

That leaves discussion posts. When I'm writing discussion posts, I'm forcing
myself to evaluate my own beliefs and become more aware of my implicit thoughts.
These posts are either easy to write or not, dependning on how much I've
thought about my world views. In the worst case, organizing all the
disparate threads of thought into a coherent narrative is a trainwreck that
takes hours to disentagle.
