A while back, one of my friends asked why I started blogging.
Amazingly, I've never explictly laid it out, so I figured it
was worth writing about.

First off, I'm blogging because I want to. This is obvious to
the point of vacuosness - of course I wouldn't write blog posts
if I didn't want to. Who would?

Still, this doesn't explain why I have this motivation. I've been
thinking about it, and ultimately I think I blog for mostly
selfish reasons.

My blog isn't very focused. I have written both technical posts meant to teach something
and non-technical posts meant to explain my point of view.
I classify them into the following categories.

Posts on topics I want to teach to other people. Thdse are
all technical. Examplws are garbled circuits and efficiently
biasing a fair coin.

Posts on topics I don't understand yet, but I want to explain
what I know so far. Examples are my post on the AlphaGo paper.

That leaves discussion posts - posts where I try to preswnt my point
pf view on a topic and the reasons why I have that perspective.
