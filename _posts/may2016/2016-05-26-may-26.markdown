When I look back on the posts I've been writing this month,
I notice I've been using a lot fewer section headings than
I did in my previous posts. Instead of making up a section
title, I'll add a

\*\*\*
{: .centered }

And move on to the next topic. I wonder why?

\*\*\*
{: .centered }

One reason I've been doing this is that making up titles
is hard. No, really, it's awful. Fun fact: back when I first
set up a personal site on Blogger, its title was actually
"Titles Are Hard". This was back when I indulged in
recursion and self-reference a bit more than I should have.
(I blame "There's a Monster at the End of This Book" for
awakening that part of myself.)

Now, although it wasn't a good blog title, it was at
least an accurate blog title. It is really hard to create a
good section title, especially when I'm writing by the
seat of my pants. When I use a title, the implicit promise I'm
giving to the reader is that the title is going to be related
to the upcoming section, possibly in some pithy way.

**This is so hard to do well!** Look, here's how my writing has gone
this week. I pick some seed topic, let it germinate into whatever
it wants, and prune the extra leaves to make it more focused. But, when
I place pressure to produce more quickly, I don't have time to do lots
of pruning. I don't know quite what I'm writing until I write it, and
when the topic is always shifting under my feet, it's hard to pick a title
that matches the ideas in the most recent paragraph.
