When I look back on the posts I've been writing this month,
I notice I've been using a lot fewer section headings than
I did in my previous posts. Instead of making up a section
title, I'll add a divider like

\*\*\*
{: .centered }

And move on to the next topic. I wonder why?

\*\*\*
{: .centered }

One reason I've been doing this is that making up titles
is hard. No, really, it's awful. Fun fact: back when I first
set up a personal site on Blogger, its title was actually
"Titles Are Hard". This was back when I indulged in
recursion and self-reference a bit more than I should have.
(I blame "There's a Monster at the End of This Book" for
awakening that part of myself.)

Now, although it wasn't a good blog title, it was at
least an accurate blog title. It is really hard to create a
good section title, especially when I'm writing by the
seat of my pants. When I use a title, the implicit promise I'm
giving to the reader is that the title is going to be related
to the upcoming section, possibly in some pithy way.

**This is so hard to do well!** Look, here's how my writing has gone
this week. First, I come up with some seed topic. From there, I
let the idea germinate into whatever it wants. I then prune the extra leaves
to make it more focused. But, when
I place pressure to produce more quickly, I don't have time to do lots
of pruning. To continue this tortured analogy, I let the bush grow, realize I'm
running out of time, trim the most blatant errors, and reveal what I have so
far.

For me, writing is this gradual process where I realize what I want to write
after I write it.
When the topic is always shifting under my feet, it's hard to pick a title
that matches the ideas in the most recent paragraphs. This blogging gauntlet
is focused on raw output, so there are no incentives to go back and decide
on good titles, when I need to focus on getting more material out there.

While I'm on the topic of complaining about writing, endings are also terrible.
I have without fail hated the first ending I wrote for every blog post.
If I had the time that day, I tried to rewrite the ending into something
more acceptable. More commonly, I left it the way it was.

Much in the way that it's hard for me to come up with a pithy way to sum
up a section, it's hard for me to come up with a nice way to end the post
as a whole. Conversations don't have a fixed ending, they continue until the
points naturally die. In writing, the standards are different, but my writing
style is closer to conversational.

On the other hand, now that I think about it, I've read several blog posts
that also didn't have a good conclusion. They simply stopped at the moment they
said everything they were planning to say.

Maybe that's okay after all.
