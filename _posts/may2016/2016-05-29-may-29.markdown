Apologies in advance if I have typos or worse writing than usual.
I'm traveling right now and don't have my laptop with me, meaning I
have to use a different writing flow.

Right now, I'm typing on a tablet, using GitHub's built in text editor.
It's actually not as bad as I thought it would bea. The touch keyboard
does a decent job of approximating a real keyboard. Of course it's a lot smaller, but it's still loads better than a phone keyboard.

However, obviously I'm making do with a non-ideal situation by using the tools I have. Typing is much, much slower than an actual keyboard. Furthermore, I don't have an easy way to check all the formatting works, besides launching the site and hoping for the best.

It's funny. I've always seen tablets as a little extraneous. I thought you either wanted a phone size thing or a laptop size thing. A tablet size thing felt like a weird middle ground. But, now that I'm using one, I can understand why it feels qualitatively different from both. Still don't think I'll buy one though.

Anyways, this is a whole new experience for me. Honestly, I wasn't expecting to even try to make a blog post today. I was just going to take the $20 hit because of how little time I had. But, when there's a will there's a way, I suppose.
