*Very minor spoilers for Ra, major spoilers for The Matrix*

Among the many excellent sequences of *Ra*, this is in my top 3.
To set the stage: Laura and Natalie have just come back from a harrowing
experience in the shared dreamscape called Tanako's world.
In that dreamscape, Laura killed someone. Natalie is not happy.

(For brevity, I've cut out some of the middle paragraphs.)

> Natalie pulls Laura aside. "I need you to do something for me."
>
> "Okay?"
>
> "I need you to stop killing people."
>
> Laura chokes. "Ah, what?"
>
> "You killed that person," Natalie says to Laura. "You could have vented the energy upwards, away from all of us. You vaporised him and you didn't need to."
>
> "He was threatening lives!"
>
> "You had neutralised that threat. That makes it murder." Natalie's tone of voice isn't even accusatory. It's completely flat.
>
> "I don't understand what you're saying. It was a dream."
>
> "**So when did you wake up?**"
>
> Laura steps through her memories one at a time. She remembers walking home. She walked all the way back from her memory palace to Tanako's world to the fissure to reality. It's a continuous record. "...We're awake right now, right?"
> 
> "That's the null hypothesis," says Natalie. "Until you can prove otherwise, always assume you're in reality. Now, repeat after me: 'We don't know what happened.'"

First off, if you like thinking about the nature of reality, check out *Ra*.
Reality is one of *Ra*'s running themes, and it's pretty great if you're okay
with the metaphysics.

Back to your regularly scheduled post. About two years ago, I remember telling
someone about the [simulation hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis).
The argument goes like this: suppose humanity can create high-fidelity simulations
of the world. Furthermore, suppose we one day simulate people who have
consciousness. Then, those simulated people may also simulate people who have
consciousness. The simulated people in the simulation may simulate more people.
The three-nested simulation may simulate more people. Repeat, and repeat.

In this set-up, there are many simulations, and only one reality. Thus, one
of three things must hold.

* Most civilizations cannot simulate self-aware beings.
* Most civilizations can simulate self-aware beings, but choose not to.
* Most civilizations can and do simulate self-aware beings.

And, if the last holds true, we are very likely living in a simulated world,
not a real one.

I accept this argument, and propose a new corollary. It goes like this: we're
probably a simulation, but who gives a shit? It's real to me.
