Now that my [NIPS submission is done]({% post_url 2016-05-20-may-20 %}), I have
time to write a bit about my feelings towards the student lifestyle.

The thing about academia is that workloads are incredibly variable. The week
before a deadline is hell on earth, while the weeks after it can be incredibly
relaxing. When you're a student, work blends into your life. The time you can
do your work is very flexible, which makes it easy to put off until you have
to pull an all-nighter.

For the last two weeks of classes this semester, I had two final projects
to finish. I was behind enough that I ended up going. It was reaching
the point where I was waking up, going into lab, and not leaving until midnight,
every single day. One day, I noticed it was 1 AM, and did some mental
calculation. "Hm, so I got up at 9 AM. I've been working for 16 hours. But,
I went to lecture, and also got meals, so really I've only been working
for *12* hours! That's not...so...bad..."

And then the penny dropped. Working until midnight every day was my new standard.
Working at least 12 hours every day was my new standard. Mind you, this is
including weekends - I'm pretty sure the only day I took off was the Sunday
in between those two weeks.

At one point, I realized *this was incredibly unhealthy for me*, but I
couldn't **stop**. My project was due Thursday, meaning I needed the poster
done by Wednesday, meaning I needed to finish my experiment code by Tuesday
because it needed to run overnight. The timeline I had to rise to shunted
everything except work out of my life, and I didn't see any way to push free time
back in.

At Berkeley, I've never been able to get my life into a schedule. I'll add
things to my calendar, then not do them. For reference, right now, I have
a recurring event to write a post from 2 PM - 4 PM every day. I don't think
I've ever actually written a post in that block. It's effectively a glorified
daily notification.

When I have the freedom to arrange work however I like, it all gets down at
night, or right before I need to go out for food. It's too easy for me
to justify pushing it off.

I know some people who argue this isn't a bug, it's a feature. Procrastination
is what happens when you don't have the motivation to get your work done.
Thus, you'll end up working exactly when you're motivated to.

Sure, that's true, but I'd much rather have my misery around deadlines get
averaged out into the weeks leading up to it.

What annoys me the most is that this is entirely avoidable, if I learned to use
proper scheduling and actually put theory into practice, but I haven't done so.
Every time I try to use a productivity hack, I only get to keep it for a week
at most, and then it feels like too much work for not enough gain. Somehow,
I need to hack it to make doing productivity hacks fun, and I haven't figured
out a way to make this work yet.

So until then, here I am. A procrastinating workaholic, who sometimes uses
work as an excuse not to hang out, even when it seems like I shouldn't have to
do this.
