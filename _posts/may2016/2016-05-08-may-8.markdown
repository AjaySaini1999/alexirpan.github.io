When it's 10:20 PM, and I have to write a 500 word post, and
I have no idea what's I'm going to write about, you know I'm
going to be dredging the bottom of the self-reference barrel.

So, I have 100 minutes to write a post. By itself, this wouldn't
be the trickiest task. Some of the posts on previous days were written
in less time than that. However, on those days I knew I would be
time-crunched, and deliberately thought about a topic I wanted to
write about. That let me plan out an outline in advance. When you
know what you want to say, it's surprisingly easy to say it.

In this case...that's not so true. I didn't bother trying to think of a topic
ahead of time, and here we are. One draft, only draft, let's
see if my stream of consciousness is remotely coherent.

First off, I could always just give up. It's $20. Twenty dollars
isn't that much for me (which I'm sure says something about
my socioeconomic status.) But here I am, writing out words.

So, let's assume I'm acting rationally, or at least acting in a way
that could be interpreted as the actions of a rational person. Then,
we immediately prove some interesting things about myself. For instance,
I value 100 minutes of my time at more than $20.

On the other hand, that assumes I get nothing out of writing blog posts,
or rising to meet one of my self-imposed challenges. I get a really
big sense of accomplishment when I finish something, and that feeling
is definitely worth more than $20 to me. In retrospect, the feeling
of accomplishment is worth a LOT more than that - it might be my
primary motivator. It was one of the biggest things that made deciding
not to go to grad school so difficult. Should probably keep a closer
eye on that.

Now, on the other other hand...I have a final tomorrow. I have not
studied for this final as much as I should have. Evidentally, I value
writing blog posts and going on road trips to LA more than
studying for finals. Which I guess makes
sense. Writing tons of garbage is so much more interesting than
reading my scribbled notes from weeks long past. I can justify not
studying by saying "I'm a second semester senior", "I'm taking this
class pass-no pass", and from your perspective you might be wondering
why I feel guilty at all. But I do. It's probably tied to that feeling
of accomplishment; the feeling I get when I fail to do something
simply because I didn't put in enough time is terrible. For me, there
isn't some line in the sand marking things I want to do and things
I should do but don't want to. It's one big gradient of priorities and
procrastination. Envisioning achievement motivates working towards that
achievement, even if the path required to get there isn't worth it.

You know, that whole paragraph was a whole lot of nothing. Just go mentally
edit it out from your memory.

Hey, will you look at that. I hit 500 words! Cool. Nice.

(Also, I think I'll be fine for the final. If I'm not, well, life is one
big tapestry. When the tapestry's big enough, it's okay to have some patches
of baby barf green.)
