I've been working all day on turning my final project for CS 281B into
a NIPS paper all of today. The submission deadline is tomorrow, 9 AM.
I have no idea how I convinced myself this was a good idea.

First off, the odds that I actually get accepted to NIPS is almost nil.
My final project has the bare minimum of algorithm design to make it even
justifiable to write a paper in the first place, and the experiments I ran
all gave negative results. Furthermore, I worked on this project entirely by
myself, with little to no input from any grad students/professors. That means
my writeup is going to be very unrefined. I don't have the time to get feedback
on my writing, because everyone I know who could give feedback is busy attending
ICRA, and the time it would take for me to explain what I'm doing and for them
to read my paper isn't worth it. Even if this was the most well-written paper
in the world, the combination of not very novel ideas and negative results
feels like a death sentence.

What makes this an even worse idea is that I didn't even learn about the NIPS
deadline until 2 days ago. Sure, let's submit to NIPS! Why not! It's not like
I've spent the past few days playing Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney in my
pajamas all day, meaning I have to go through a super jarring context shift
into the work all day mindset.
It's not like this is my last week staying at Berkeley, and
I should probably be trying to meet up with friends before we all head away
from one another. OH WAIT, EXCEPT BOTH THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE? YEAH, THEY ARE.

UUUUUUGGGGGGHHHHHHHH.

(Yes, if you couldn't tell I'm a bit annoyed with myself. It was probably a
bad idea to even write a blog post when I'm in a mood of productive anger,
but here we are.)

The odds I give myself for even getting into NIPS is so small that I decided
it wasn't even worth sending my paper around for feedback, because it would
diminish the chances of other people getting their papers accepted by enough
to make it net negative for the lab. Maybe this is circular logic to convince
myself I don't want to talk to people, but at this point I'm too tired to work
towards internal consistency.

If you were expecting a post about existential risk, I'm sorry the title
baited you. I was considering writing about it, but decided I wouldn't be
able to properly cover it, considering that I'm writing this post on an
insanely short deadline and I need to finish my paper literally tonight.
Tomorrow I have to, like, graduate and walk on stage high-fiving my
professors.

Anyways this is a huge pile of bullshit, and I almost feel like I'm cheating
myself for writing this just to make sure I didn't have to pay $20. Holy
shit the quality of this post is going to be PISS POOR, and writing an
angry post is maaaaaaybe not the best thing to save on the Internet for
all to see.

If I had the time to write a decent post, here's what I would have said.

* The odds of me getting accepted are small, but I was always planning
to refine my final project for my research page currently under construction.
The NIPS deadline just gave me a good deadline to actually work on it
and spring me out of my hedonistic haze.
* When the paper is done, I will get to say I submitted a paper to
a top tier machine learning conference, which is actually a decently big
deal.
* I'm not sure how I feel about existential risk, but in this case the
journey of finding the best way to explain my ideas to a curious but
unfamiliar audience is my main motivation.

But I didn't have the time to find a good way to naturally meander through
all those points, so you get this instead. Many paragraphs of anger
and angst, with all the meat at the very end.

There, okay, that's it. I'm outta here, I have a paper to write.
