I've been working on turning my final project for CS 281B into a NIPS paper all of
today, and I have no idea how I convinced myself this was a good idea.

First off, the odds that I actually get accepted to NIPS is almost nil.
My final project has the bare minimum of algorithm design to make it even
justifiable to write a paper in the first place, and the experiments I ran
all gave negative results. Furthermore, I worked on this project entirely by
myself, with little to no input from any grad students/professors. That means
my writeup is going to be very unrefined. I don't have the time to get feedback
on my writing, because everyone I know who could give feedback is busy attending
ICRA, and the time it would take for me to explain what I'm doing and for them
to read my paper isn't worth it. Even if this was the most well-written paper
in the world, the combination of not very novel ideas and negative results
feels like a death sentence.

What makes this an even worse idea is that I didn't even learn about the NIPS
deadline until 2 days ago. Sure, let's submit to NIPS! Why not! It's not like
I've spent the past few days playing Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney in my
pajamas all day, meaning I have to go through a super jarring context shift
into the work all day mindset.
It's not like this is my last week staying at Berkeley, and
I should probably be trying to meet up with friends before we all head away
from one another. OH WAIT, EXCEPT BOTH THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE? YEAH, THEY ARE.

UUUUUUGGGGGGHHHHHHHH.

Yes, if you couldn't tell I'm a bit annoyed with myself. It was probably a
bad idea to even write a blog post when I'm in a mood of productive anger,
but here we are. I'm hoping this post will be funny as balls in retrospect, but
who knows.

The odds I give myself for even getting into NIPS is so small that I decided
it wasn't even worth sending my paper around for feedback, because it would
diminish the chances of other people getting their papers accepted by enough
to make it net negative for the lab. Maybe this is circular logic to convince
myself I don't want to talk to people, but at this point I'm too tired to work
towards internal consistency.
