About a week ago, a friend of mine made a Facebook post.

Everybody laugh, cue snare drum, etc. But, it got me thinking.
This friend of mine is someone who's done functional programming,
and thinks a lot about programming languages. It's fitting for him
to think about catching mistakes at compile time, because that's
the great strength of functional programming. To quote the
[Haskell wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Why_Haskell_just_works),

> A lot of people experience a curious phenomenon when they start using Haskell: Once your code compiles it usually works.

I started reflecting on other times people have used their area of
expertise to reason about events in their life, and the list grew
faster than I thought. A student in the graduate level machine learning/stats
course I'm taking said he had very high regret because he procrastinated
making his poster until now.

Last weekend, I did a puzzle hunt with someone who does systems
research in [AMPLab](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/). At one point, a few
members left to do an on-campus puzzle. He said it made more sense to work on
a new puzzle instead of getting caught up on the partial progress of the puzzle
they abandoned. Or more specifically, he said they already had that puzzle loaded
into their cache, so it wasn't worth the context switching time.

In one memorable math session, someone decided the word "three" was a variable,
leading to insane sentences like "If three is bigger than eight, then this property
should hold."

And if it wasn't already clear, I'm among these people who have let their
technical knowledge blend into their real world thoughts. I literally just
wrote a post about [online milk tea regret minimization]({% post_url 2016-05-05-may-5 %}).
I've also described my decision making as a [priority queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue).
I get offered a task with high priority. I can either do it like a productive
person, or procrastinate it by placing it back into the queue with lower
priority. Perhaps that's my algorithms side bleeding out.

To me, it seems like the more you think about a subject, the more it shapes
the way you think in general. I'm sure that leads to all sorts of stereotypes.
Physiscists round constants to orders of magnitude, theoretical computer
scientists throw out constants entirely.
