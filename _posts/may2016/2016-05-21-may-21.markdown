*I was hesitant to write on this topic, because I care about it a lot and don't
want to mess it up. Eventually I decided it was worth writing a beta post.*

In April of this year, Anca Dragan gave [a presentation on her work in
human-computer interaction](https://www.facebook.com/events/1083061028418433/).
Anca is one of those terrifyingly smart people that make you feel slightly
ashamed about yourself. She did a PhD at CMU, was nominated for several best paper awards at top
robotics conferences, and was hired straight out of her PhD to a
assistant professorship at Berkeley.

The event was hosted by FEM Tech, a new student organization that, quote,

> promotes gender diversity and inspire women from all majors to excel in technology careers. Through organized seminars, mentorship programs, training workshops, and networking events, FEM Tech will provide a supportive community for all majors to create meaningful connections with like-minded women. We hope to excite new interest in tech and provide support for women already in STEM majors.

I did not go to this talk. I was very busy that week, and the event description
sounded like it wouldn't go into enough depth to be interesting to me. Or rather,
that is the excuse I gave myself.

In truth, I walked towards the event, and saw almost everyone there was female.
I wasn't comfortable with that, so I turned around and went back to the library.

I only grasped the full implications when I was at the library doors.
I wasn't comfortable with an all-female
room, at a time when many women in tech have to deal with an all-male room. *Oh, so that's
what that feels like. I don't have to deal with this, but they do. Does
that make me part of the problem?*

Several of my friends are worried about the reasonable chance Trump has at
becoming president. Of course, the majority of my friend group is planning to
back the Democratic nominee. (What, you were expecting me to know
a Berkeley CS major *who would vote for a Republican?*
Tell me if you find one of those, because that's
a rare breed.)

Some have semi-jokingly talked about finding ways to live in Europe next
year. Many are seriously worried about the damage a Trump presidency could
cause.

Meanwhile, I'm thinking about the 2008 general election, and the voters who
were genuinely worried about what an Obama presidency meant for the nation.
I've seen interviews from volunteers for the McCain campaign - they were
truly frightened about how an Obama presidency would erode American values,
destroy the economy, and send the US into a death spiral.

*So now you know what it feels like, to see a candidate who you don't just
disagree with, but disagree with vehemently. You fear a candidate who
will rip the nation asunder, but this is nothing new. That fear existed
before, exists now, and will always exist in the future. But now you get
to see it with your own eyes.*

Looking back, it doesn't feel like I had a tough life.

Yes, I went to a challenging high school and a tough college, and have
definitely had struggles, but it doesn't feel like I've had to work as hard
as other people. I've never had to worry about failing a class. While students
are venting about how hard a final, I walk out feeling like I solved every
problem.

I worry what that means for my empathy. How am I supposed to effectively cheer
up a student for the class I'm TAing, if I got an A+ in it? How am I supposed
to understand implicit prejudice, when I'm a male Asian in Silicon Valley?
How do I justify avoiding crazy working hours, when those in poverty
have to deal with them out of necessity, not choice?

I try to see suffering as input-independent. It doesn't matter if someone is
crying because their salary is below $100,000, or if they're crying because
they didn't have enough to eat. The inputs don't entitle us to write off
the suffering of a privileged person, and this continues to hold for a privileged
person like myself. Suffering is symmetrical, no matter the cause, and we
should strive to empathize with it.

We should try, and yet it feels like I *don't*. I can walk to an artisan
tea shop every day and ignore the homeless on the streets. I don't understand
what it feels like to view the police with fear, or a bank account with dread,
and I never want to, because I'm in a position where I never have to, and quite
reasonably decide I don't want to add pain into my life for the sake of having
pain in my life.

Yesterday, I lost. I didn't finish my post in time. I donate $20 to some
effective charity, and it feels like I lost. It's going to help people, and
it feels like I lost.

I don't know how to reconcile this, and some part of me doesn't want to.

On days like these, I have to wonder. Which is worse - always living with wool
worn over your own eyes, or taking the wool off and pulling it back on by
your own accord?
