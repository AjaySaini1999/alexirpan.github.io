*I was hesitant to write on this topic, because I care about it a lot and don't
want to mess it up. Eventually I decided it was worth writing a beta post.*

In April of this year, Anca Dragan gave [a presentation on her work in
human-computer interaction](https://www.facebook.com/events/1083061028418433/).
Anca is one of those terrifyingly smart people that make you feel slightly
ashamed about yourself. She did a PhD at CMU, was nominated for several best paper awards at top
robotics conferences, and was hired straight out of her PhD to a
assistant professorship at Berkeley.

The event was hosted by FEM Tech, a new student organization that, quote,

> promotes gender diversity and inspire women from all majors to excel in technology careers. Through organized seminars, mentorship programs, training workshops, and networking events, FEM Tech will provide a supportive community for all majors to create meaningful connections with like-minded women. We hope to excite new interest in tech and provide support for women already in STEM majors.

I did not go to this talk. I was very busy that week, and the event description
sounded like it wouldn't go into enough depth to be interesting to me. Or rather,
that is the excuse I gave myself.

In truth, I walked towards the event, and saw almost everyone there was female.
I wasn't comfortable with that, so I turned around and went back to the library.

I only grasped the full implications when I was at the library doors.
I wasn't comfortable with an all-female
room, at a time when many women in tech have to deal with an all-male room. *Oh, so that's
what that feels like. I don't have to deal with this, but they do. Does
that make me part of the problem?*

Several of my friends are worried about the reasonable chance Trump has at
becoming president. Of course, the majority of my friend group is planning to
back the Democratic nominee. (What, you were expecting me to know
a Berkeley CS major *who would vote for a Republican?*
Tell me if you find one of those, because that's
a rare breed.)

Some have semi-jokingly talked about finding ways to live in Europe next
year. Many are seriously worried about the damage a Trump presidency could
cause.

Meanwhile, I'm thinking about the 2008 general election, and the voters who
were genuinely worried about what an Obama presidency meant for the nation.
I've seen interviews from volunteers for the McCain campaign - they were
truly frightened about how an Obama presidency would erode American values,
destroy the economy, and send the US into a death spiral.

*So now you know what it feels like, to see a candidate who you don't just
disagree with, but disagree with vehemently. You fear a candidate who
will rip the nation asunder, but this is nothing new. That fear has
always existed.*
