I graduated from college today.

It's not my usual style, but on today of all days, I'm going
to try something different.

\*\*\*

In this semester, we have faced plenty of lasts. The last
midterm. The last final. The last spring break, the last time
we'll have to dodge flyers on Sproul.

But this last is different from the rest. It is our last
day as undergraduates of this university. It's been a long
time coming, and yet it still felt like it was coming
too soon. As the days passed inexorably by, we realized,
perhaps for the first time, that time was running short,
and soon we would be walking different paths.

Our graduation is a a symbol of everything we went through
these past four years. It serves as a capstone of not
just our academic achievements, but of our personal
achievements as well. Everything has been building towards
this moment, and that gives it a weight that few
moments can ever match.

We'll remember our undergrad in different ways.
Some will remember that party where they met the one for them.
Others will remember the day their paper was accepted for
publication. Or, there may be more tragic memories. The
day we took a midterm, and realized we were drowning in
material. The day we decided it was for the best if we
stopped seeing each other.
After spending years living and breathing college,
it's impossible to leave without a special moment.

There will be other last days, and not all of them will
be pretty. The last day of our job. The last day of our marriage,
or perhaps more worringly the last day we're even in a
relationship. All things come to an end, although
I sincerely hope your last last day never comes to pass.

However, just as today is a day of lasts, it is also
a day of firsts. We must leave college, whether we want
to or not. Undergrad is not an end in itself. Rather, it is
the means to a nobler goal. Like chickens we incubated
inside our little eggs, bouncing from class to class.
We laughed at the worries we had in high school, and in the
dark confided at the worries we had in the now. Together,
we grew into the people we are today.

In the end, whether we want to or not, we must hatch from
our shells, pierce the veil, and look out onto the
outside world.

And you know what?

We're going to be the best goddamn people the world has
ever seen.

Over the past four years, we've taken great strides to
be the kick-ass people we've always wanted to be, and we'll
keep walking down the road we lay for ourselves, brick by
brick. We may not be in college anymore, but we'll always
be students.

Tomorrow is our next first day. We'll look up at the vast,
wild, unfriendly world, and we'll bare our heads up high, and
we'll march unflinchingly into the next page of our story.

Mathcamp 2010, and Sheryl Sandberg's speech from today. I would
like to thank both.*
