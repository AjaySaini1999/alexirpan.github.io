I graduated from college today.

It's not my usual style, but on this of all days, I'm going
to try something different.

\*\*\*
{: .centered }

Today was the last day of our undergrad.

There were previous lasts in this semester. The last midterm,
the last final. The last spring break, the last club meeting.
The last time we'll see each other in real life.

But this last is different from the rest. It is our last
day as students of this university. As the days ticked
by, we realized that time was running short, and that soon
we would be walk different paths.

Our commencement was a symbol of everything we went through
these past four years. Or for some, perhaps they only spent
three. By itself, commencement is just a ceremony, but in
context it serves as the capstone of not just our
academic lives, but our personal ones as well.
That gives it a weight that few other moments in our life
can have.

We'll remember it in different ways. Some will remember the
excellent speech Sheryl Sandberg gave, which received
press coverage within hours. Others won't remember
commencement itself, or may not have attended, but they'll
remember their college experience.
After spending years living and breathing the college life,
it's impossible to leave it without at least one special
moment.

This may have been our last day of our undergrad, but it
is not our last last day. There will be other last days.
The last day of our job. The last day before our marriage,
or perhaps the last day *of* our marriage.
All things come to an end. I sincerely hope your
last last day is far, far away.

However, just as today is a day of lasts, it is also
a day of firsts. We have to leave college, whether we want
to or not. The point of undergrad is not to stay in
undergrad for the rest of our lives. The point is to learn
something new. It could be something technical, or it could
be something about ourselves. In either case, we incubate
with others just like us, laughing at how naive we were
in high school, and confiding how naive we still feel
about the real world.
