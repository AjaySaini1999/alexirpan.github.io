 If you don't know who Alan Moore is, let me tell a story.

Alan Moore is one of the most influential comic writers of all time. Among his works is Watchmen, which I consider to be a masterpiece. It's visually rich, thick with plot and symbolism, and has an all around engrossing narrative.

Alan Moore is also known for having very strong opinions about adaptations of his work. Moore has without fail hated adaptations of his work, so much so that he refuses to be listed in the credits of those adaptations. The one exception is the animated adaptation for "The Man Who Has Everything".

So, when a Watchmen movie was announced, his response was typical - he refused to see it and did not want to be credited. However, his reasoning was interesting. Alan Moore believed Watchmen was unadaptable. He thought it was a story that only worked as a comic.

> There are things we did with Watchmen that could only work in a comic, and were indeed designed to show off things that other media can't.

I haven't found a quote by Moore where he explains this, but here's a fan theory I quite liked. Watchmen is very visually dense. It uses tons of visual callbacks, lots of visual motifs. An entire chapter is palindromic for Pete's sake. It's rich enough that sometimes you want to pause and take in all the detail in a given panel.

A comic lets you do this, but a film doesn't. A film pushes images at you frame after frame. It dictates the pace of each scene. In contrast, when reading a comic, **the reader chooses how long they spend on each page.** When reading a comic, time can be stretched or contracted or made to run backwards if the reader wishes it to be. When Dr. Manhattan talks about determinism and seeing all times at once, it can be interpreted as a commentary on comics themselves, and it loses impact when told as a movie.
