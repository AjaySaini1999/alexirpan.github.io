I'll be honest, I expected to feel a lot different after this month than I actually do.

Perhaps that's my bias towards the idea of One Big Revelation that changes everything. The kind of turning point that people use when talking about their life in retrospect.

For me, it doesn't feel like I changed that much. Maybe there was a big change, but it's only something I can recognize in the future. In the now, the me of yesterday is too familiar, and the me of two days ago is still fresh in my mind. For now, it's too difficult for me to see the accumulation of subtle shifts, if there were any.

What went well, and what didn't? For starters, writing 500 words every day was both less and more time consuming than expected. Some of the fastest posts were written in under 20 minutes, because I had to.

However, other posts took over four hours. Hopefully this is just because of work ballooning to fill my free time, and it won't take that long to write once I start working full-time.

Another thing I learned is that a new topic every day is too much for me. There are quite a few posts that I genuinely regret writing. The ideas backing them up were either illformed or nonexistent, and I ran out of material pretty quickly after the first week. I have blog-worthy ideas more often than once every two weeks, but less often than every day.

I could have avoided this by dedicating more than one post to a given topic, and in fact was expecting to do so, but that ended up falling apart after the exploration-exploitation posts. I'm simply not familiar with the serial mindset of posting part after part. When I write, I like to rearrange paragraphs and ideas all over the place, until I get an ordering I like. This stops working when I have to publish words every day. Publishing half or a third of an intended post fixes the ideas I start with and the order they are presented in, and trying to continue old posts feels like writing while trapped in a corner. I have on occasion scrapped entire drafts when I realized I wasn't writing about what I actually wanted to write about. If I had published the start of those drafts, I would have been forced to leave them unfinished, which doesn't sit well with me.

I know serial writing is doable, it's just that I can't do it yet.

On to what went well. I managed to write a post every day, only missing deadline once. Attaching money as a cost worked as planned, because it gave me impetus to write posts even when I was traveling. At some point, I realized that blogging was something I wanted as a regular part of my life, and the potential loss each day was becoming less important. It still mattered, but it wasn't the biggest reason anymore.

I flushed most of my blogging idea queue, and the ideas I didn't use are ones that require tons of introspection (meaning tons of time) or require more planning because they're story based.

I successfully beta-tested posts I've always wanted to write, and although not all of them worked out, some were very well received, more than I expected them to be. Getting to write in a context where people knew they shouldn't expect something perfect was a big help.
