When talking about games, and especially when talking about game AIs,
it's very common for people to compare the size
of the state space to other big numbers, like the number of atoms in the
universe.

EXAMPLES HERE

On some level it's understandable. The number of states is often used as
a proxy for the difficulty of the problem. Chess has CHECK states.
Go on a 19 x 19 board has CHECK states. So Go is a harder game to play,
and look, AlphaGo took a lot longer to make than DeepBlue! Checkers has
CHECK states and Backgammon has CHECK states, and they were solved a lot
earlier than both (CHECK WHEN).
