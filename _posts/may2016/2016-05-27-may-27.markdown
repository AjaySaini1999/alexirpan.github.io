If there's anything I like, it's when people do something interesting
with structure.

A good example of this is from the Firefly fanfic *Forward*. It uses
an omniscent narrator. To indicate River's general...spaciness, the
text is centered on the page, and randomly shifts between normal text,
bold text, and italics.

Another example comes up in *Ra*. Events that take place in the dreamscape
Tanako's World is right-aligned instead of left-aligned.

I'm not sure quite what makes this so interesting to me. My closest guess
is that toying with the structure reveals our implicit assumptions about
that structure. By adjusting it in the right way, we can send ideas that
are almost unrelated to the words themselves.

In any case, this means I'm usually on the lookout for ways I can mess
with or subvert the typical structure. In yesterday's post, I was pretty
pleased with myself for finding a way to use

\*\*\*
{: .centered }

twice in a row with different meanings both times. (And I'm also pleased
I found a way to use the nonstandard meaning again, but this joke is
wearing thing.)

On occasions this comes out as self-descriptive writing. A while back, I
used parallelism when describing how I used parallelism, and used a
two sentence paragraph when explaining why I liked short paragraphs.

I've been noticing that some of my blog post ideas have been based around
writing something with a strange structure. For a while, I was briefly
considering writing a post made of nothing but quotations of other work.
That post would have talked about plagiarism, while
also showing that if you use enough sources, the act of synthesizing
all the disconnected ideas is enough to make it original. Look, I even
collected some quotes for this.

Eventually I abandoned this project, because the reward-to-effort ratio was
really, really bad. I still like it conceptually, but not enough to justify
making it for real.

As an aside, video games are an especially interesting medium for this.
For visual novels like Phoenix Wright and the like, it's surprising how key
interactivity is to the whole experience. It's an example of how narratives
have to shift depending on if they're a book, a movie, or a game.
