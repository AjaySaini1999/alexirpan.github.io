If there's anything I like, it's when people do something interesting
with structure.

A good example of this is from the Firefly fanfic *Forward*.
River's thoughts are centered on the page, and will shift into bolds
or italics.

{: .centered }

*Ra* does something similar. Magic spells are written in monospaced font and
a different color.

{: .centered }

I like how toying with the structure reveals our implicit
assumptions about that structure. By adjusting it in the right way, authors can
reveal those assumptions, then push their boundaries to describe things
without words. Done properly, it gives a sense of completeness - the
text content gets tied to the medium itself, and neither can easily
be separated from the whole.

When I write blog posts, I'm on the lookout for structural gimmicks.
In [yesterday's post]({% post_url 2016-05-26-may-26 %}), I was pretty pleased with myself for finding a way to use
"\*\*\*" twice in a row, once to indicate how I use it as a section break and once
as an actual section break.
I'm also pleased I got to discuss section breaks right before using one in today's
post as well. The joke's wearing thin, so
I promise this is the last time I'll use this gag.

For a while, I was seriously
considering writing a post made entirely from quotations.
I would have cited quotes about plagiarism, using the structure to blatantly
show I was copying from everybody else. At the same time, the structure
would also show how organizing all the quotes together was itself enough to
make it original. It was going to show the boundary between plagiarism and
original thought by having elements of both appear in its construction.
Look, I even collected some quotes I was going to use.

> Plagiarize  
> Let no one else's work evade your eyes  
> Remember why the good Lord made your eyes  
> So don't shade your eyes  
> But plagiarize, plagiarize, plagiarize  
> Only be sure always to call it please "research"

Eventually I abandoned this project. I still like it conceptually, but
the reward-to-effort ratio is way too small to justify writing it.
I tried a quote-heavy post in [Memorable Quotes]({% post_url 2016-05-16-may-16 %})
and called it a day.

I know of one other person who came up with a similarly convoluted structure,
and actually went through with it. That person would be Mark Rosewater,
head designer for Magic: the Gathering. He writes weekly articles about the
design of the current sets, and sometimes about game design as a whole.

Way back in 2004, he decided to write an article on
[Elegance](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/elegance-2004-10-18-48).
It is the most divisive article he's ever written. I haven't kept up with
MTG very closely, but I doubt anything has matched the backlash or praise.

The structure is completely insane. The article is a home page of 50 words.
Each word is a link to another 50 word snippet. It's conceptually beautiful,
but it's also horrendously difficult for the reader.
The fanmail got crazy enough that he ended up spending another
[article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/elegant-response-2004-11-01)
responding to the reader response to "Elegance".

I'd recommend reading his response article by itself, but I'll briefly summarize
it here. Rosewater's key point was that elegance was a very difficult concept
to explain. It was so difficult that he felt the best way to explain elegance
was to have the article itself be elegant. He wanted to highlight the gap between
elegant concepts and elegant executions, so he wrote an article that showed how
one didn't imply the other. The disconnect between the elegance of its
structure and its
readability was the whole point of the article. The words themselves were less
important.

Personally, I got sick of "Elegance" around the 7th link, but after reading
his response, I have a lot of respect for the idea. It's a fantastic example
of how structure influences communication.
