If there's anything I like, it's when people do something interesting
with structure.

A good example of this is from the Firefly fanfic *Forward*. It uses
an omniscent narrator. To indicate River's general...spaciness, the
text is centered on the page, and randomly shifts between normal text,
bold text, and italics.

Another example comes up in *Ra*. Events that take place in the dreamscape
Tanako's World is right-aligned instead of left-aligned.

I'm not sure quite what makes this so interesting to me. My closest guess
is that toying with the structure reveals our implicit assumptions about
that structure. By adjusting it in the right way, we can send ideas that
are almost unrelated to the words themselves.
