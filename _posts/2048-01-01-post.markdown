Here's a neat magic trick that involves no magic, only math.

The setup: you and a partner invite a volunteer to the stage. You present
the volunteer with a standard 52 card deck of playing cards. You close your eyes,
while your partner asks the volunteer to pick 5 arbitrary cards from the deck.
Your partner places one of the 5 cards into his or her pocket, then deals the
4 remaining cards in some order.

You then open your eyes, look at the 4 cards dealt, and name the missing card to
much fanfare. To show there is no trickery, you ask someone else to come up and
pick 5 cards, and again you succeed. And again, and again...

The puzzle: devise a scheme that makes this trick possible.

As with most limited information puzzles, the first reaction of most people is to
find creative ways to communicate more information than intended, so here are
the more extensive rules.

- The scheme must work with any choice of 5 cards from the deck.
- The predictor sees 4 of the cards, and their ordering. No other information is
allowed.
- After removing a card, the partner must deal all 4 remaining cards.
