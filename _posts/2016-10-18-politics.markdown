title:  "How I View Politicians"

Let me start by saying I'm incredibly underqualified to discuss anything
about politics.

On the other hand, lots of people are underqualified, and that doesn't stop
them from getting into flame wars on the Internet. And what, my understanding
of politics is going
to get better if I avoid thinking about it? That's literally the opposite
of what you should be doing if you want to understand politics.

So here's how this post is going to go. I explain how I view politics and
politicians. And that's it. No follow-up. I wait for people to object to the
stupider things I say, and then I don't reply to their objections unless
I want to.

Is this going to make me a political genius? No. Am I looking to become
a political genius? No.

All I want is to be less of a political idiot. This seems like a good way
to get some easy gains in that direction. (In general, it's okay
to study a topic, while having no intention to become an expert in that
topic.)

Here we go.

The Two Rules
-----------------------------------------------------------

I have two golden rules about politics.

1. Politicians are motivated by two desires: power for the sake of power, and
power for the sake of making the world a better place.
2. No one gets everything they want. Therefore, politics turns into a game
of compromise and quid pro quo.

Let's break it down.

The Power to Change the World
===========================================================

Most politicians want power. I don't think this is a controversial claim.
Try saying the reverse. "Most politicians don't want power." That sounds
resoundingly false to me.

What they want power for? Some people want power for
the feeling of dominance over others. The vaguely euphoric feeling they get,
when they tell people what to do, and it *gets done.*

I know some political scientists claim that having power is the **only**
desire of politicians. That's not entirely wrong, and it's also not entirely
true. If someone just wanted power, they'd probably have an easier time in
the private sector. (I'll freely admit this is purely my intuition talking.)

That leads to the second part of the rule. When I look at a politician, I see
somebody who believes world order is broken. When someone runs for office,
their entire thesis is that they'd be a better leader than the current one.
So of course they want power - the people in power are doing it wrong!

To place it in narrative terms, it's the difference between a hero who
became a hero for fame, and a hero who became a hero because they believed
no one else was going to rise to the occasion.

It's somewhat icky to admit out loud, but sometimes the first step to improving
the world is a naked grab for power. If you have influence, it makes it
much easier to convince people to act the way you think they ought to.

And this should go without saying, but all politicians are genuinely trying
to make the world a better place. Including the ones that disagree with you.
Politicians aren't trolls. They don't disagree with you solely to piss you
off. They disagree with you because their better world looks different from
your better world.

That being said, how much this altruistic desire matters is dependent on the
politician. A town mayor is more likely to care about helping people.
A senator is closer towards the end of power for power's sake.
Someone running for president almost certainly has power as their primary goal.
Only a very hungry sort of person would look at the presidency,
look at the incredible stress is causes, consider the increased odds of death
by assassination, understand that a large part of the world is going to hate
them with undying passion, and conclude that yeah, they want that.

(As a corollary, I'm not bothered when people attack politicians for
being opportunists. I expect this of them. Whether they do so
discreetly or openly doesn't influence my opinion by much.)

Even the most cynical interpretation of politics doesn't sound that bad to
me. When I was an intern, the city mayor visited our
office, to talk about the role of technology in government.
During the Q&A session, an audience member asked how politicians could justify
switching positions so often. The mayor said that of course politicians are
going to switch positions to match what votes want to do. Otherwise, they
wouldn't be representing their constituents.

I saw his reply as a positive spin on this: *even politicians motivated
by just power have to follow the will of the voters.*
If a majority of the country agrees that interracial marriage should be legal,
and a politician says they don't approve of it, they're going to lose their
next election. That's it. No way out. And therefore every politician agrees
that interracial marriage is okay, despite the fact that as recently as
2013, [thirteen percent of Americans did not approve of marriage between blacks and
whites](http://www.gallup.com/poll/163697/approve-marriage-blacks-whites.aspx).
I'm guessing the fraction is lower among members of Congress, but there are over
500 people in Congress. I think it's reasonable to assume at least one privately
disagrees with interracial marriage, but goes along with it publicly.

At some point, there's no difference between pandering to racists and being a
racist. And similarly, at some point there's no difference between pandering
to equal rights activists and believing in equal rights.

**Votes are the means by which the public keeps a politician's desire for power
aligned with the public's interests.** Unfortunately, what's best for the
nation isn't always what the nation wants, but that's the world we live in.
Someone who doesn't pander for votes is going to lose their election to someone
who does. And remember, the whole reason people go into politics is because
they believe they'll do a better job than everyone else running.

It does bother me that politicians may be saying things they don't believe
in, but considering the other upsides of democracy, I'm not too upset about the
current state of affairs.


"How About a Nice Game of Politics?"
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Take a bunch of people, all interested in advancing their own agenda. Then
throw them into a room, and tell them they have to agree on something.

That's what Congress feels like to me. Hence, the second rule of politics:
no one gets everything they want.

The president has a lot of power, but the president isn't a dictator.
Similarly, a congressman or congresswoman is just one person in the House
of Representatives. Governments are huge systems of incredible complexity.
All things considered, it's surprising they actually work.

To advance their pet issues, politicians have to balance their personal
convictions with the realities of their situation. People who stick to their
guns and refuse to make concessions tend not to get anything done.

That's not saying stubbornness doesn't have its place. Weaponized stubbornness
can be a powerful tool. Consider the Obama administration.
The broad narrative I heard from my decidedly Democratic bubble was that
Republicans blocked Democratic legislation by being obstinate.

If you ally yourself with the blue tribe, sure, that sucks. But think about the
broader play. Republicans stall the legislative process, making voters
disillusioned by Democratic leadership. That gives ammunition for Republicans
to use in upcoming midterm elections, which already tend to swing against
the president's party.

The Democrats know all of this, but the clock is still ticking on this
power play. They now have two options. Make huge concessions that
get their bills through (at the cost of the bills' original spirits), or
gamble that painting Republicans as do-nothings will be enough come election
time.

Which move was right? Or were there other moves? I don't know.
The point is that politics is messy. You don't get into Congress without
some level of shrewdness. It's filled with backroom deals and lobbyists, and
it's all a part of the game.

You can try to rise above the game, proclaiming that governments should hold
themselves to higher ideals. Then you lose to the people who compromised
their principles and accepted money from lobbyists.

Politicians have to learn how to navigate this mess, or else they're not
the leader they promised voters they were going to be.

That means quid pro quo. It means advocating for something
you don't believe in, because you were promised support for the bill they
care about. Accepting money from lobbyists even if you don't want to,
because you're stuck in a political prisoner's dilemma. Over time, politicians
become exactly the kind of person they hated as a teenager.

In short, politics is where ideals go to die.

The great politicians are not the ones with the purest hearts. The great
politicians are the ones that recognize the system, dive into it with
disdain, and surface with the general thrust of the bill they wanted to pass.


What Guides my Vote?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Given this lens, what makes me decide I should vote for a specific politician?

My main goal is to support politicians who publicly support causes that
match my belief. They could be lying, but guessing what they believe behind
their claims is a road towards madness. It's easier for me to trust what they
say. And if they don't actually believe in their cause, who cares? They have
to support it to get votes, and if they didn't try to support it after getting
elected, they're not getting my vote again.

My secondary goal is to support politicians that hold council and deeply
consider the best solutions to issues. Politicians are trying to
make the world a better place, but they're not going to be experts in everything.
Good politicians stay informed by surrounding themselves with experts and asking
them questions. Great politicians actually change their mind because of what
experts say.

(This is why I've never been very bothered by attacks based around
politicians flip-flopping. Why should I care that they voted against something
four years ago, if they're voting for it now? Is it really that unreasonable
that they changed their position?)

Finally, I support politicians who look like they'll actually get things
done. I'm much fonder of proposals that push the status quo by a bit instead of
a lot. It's hard enough to pass a bill. Proposing a radical bill that most of
the legislature hates is almost always a fool's errand.

Well there you have it. My broad viewpoints on politics. I'd like to think that
it's not totally wrong. But I think the feedback will be the judge of that.
