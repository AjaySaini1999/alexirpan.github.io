title:  "How I View Politicians"

I'm not sure why you're here to get political opinions. I'm incredibly
underqualified to discuss anything about politics.

On the other hand, lots of people are underqualified, and that doesn't stop
the flame wars on the Internet. And what, my understanding of politics is going
to get better if I avoid thinking about it? That's literally the opposite
of what you should be doing if you want to understand politics.

So here's how this post is going to go. I explain how I view politics and
politicians. And that's it. No followup. I wait for people to object to the
stupider things I say, and think about it.

Is this going to make me a politicial genius? No. Am I looking to become
a political genius? No. I'm looking to be less of a political idiot.
Broaden my horizons a bit, see what happens.

Here we go.

The Two Rules
===========================================================

I have two golden rules about politics.

1. Politicians are motivated by two desires: power for the sake of power, and
power for the sake of making the world a better place.
2. No one gets everything they want. Therefore, politics turns into a game
of compromise and quid pro quo.

Let's break it down.

The Power to Change the World
-----------------------------------------------------------

All politicians want power. I don't think this is a controversial claim.
Try saying the reverse. "Some politicians don't want power." I have trouble
thinking of a politician that statement could apply to.

The question, then, is what they want power for. Some people want power for
the feeling of dominance over others. The vaguely euphoric feeling they get,
when they tell people what to do, and it *gets done.*

I know some political scientists claim that having power is the **only**
desire of politicians. That's not entirely wrong, and it's also not entirely
true. If someone just wanted power, they'd probably have an easier time in
the private sector. (I'll freely admit that's purely my intuition.)

That leads to the second part of the rule. When I look at a politician, I see
somebody who believes world order is broken. When someone runs for office,
their entire thesis is that they'd be a better leader than the current one.
So of course they want power - the people in power are doing it wrong!

To place it in narrative terms, it's the difference between a hero who
became a hero for fame, and a hero who became a hero because they believed
no one else was going to rise to the occasion.

It's somewhat icky to admit out loud, but sometimes the first step to making
the world a better place is seizing enough power to influence other people's
minds.

How important each of the two is comes down to both the politician and the level
of office they're running for. Someone running for town mayor is more likely to
be motivated by making the world a better place. Someone running for Senator
is closer towards the end of wanting more power. Someone running for President
almost certainly has power as their primary goal. Only a very, very interesting
sort of person would look at the Presidency, observe the incredible stress
it causes, consider the increased odds of death by assassination, and conclude
that yeah, they could run the United freaking States of America.

It's somewhat icky to admit out loud, but sometimes the first step to making
the world a better place is seizing enough power to influence other people's
minds.

And this should go without saying, but every politician is genuinely trying
to make the world a better place. It's just that they have wildly different
opinions on what an ideal world should look like. You don't devote hours to
fundraising and campaigning unless you truly believe some laws need to
change.

The other golden rule of politics is that nobody gets everything of what they
want.

Governments are vast systems of incredible complexity. It's surprising that
they work at all, all things considered. That means there are large structural
forces that prevent people from doing "the right thing."

The President has a lot of power, but the President isn't a dictator.
Similarly, a Congressman or Congresswoman is just one person in the House of
Representatives. Everyone has their pet issue, and they're not all going to get
addressed, because some of those pet issues will be in direct conflict to one
another.

Politicians have to balance their personal convictions with the realities of
the system. If you Stick to your guns and refuse to make concessions, you
don't get anywhere. Look at what happened to Congress last administration.

Furthermore, everyone knows this. People liked to complain about Republicans
blocking Democratic legislation by being obstinate, but it made sense. Stall
the legislative process, make voters disillusioned by Democratice leadership,
and win back control of the House in midterm elections. And Democrats know
this, so they either had to make bigger concessions, or had to paint
Republicans as do-nothings to hurt their election chances.

The point is that politics is messy, meandering, filled with off the record
deals, and you have to learn to navigate this whole mess, or else you're
not the leader you promised the voters you were going to be. And if you
don't deliver, you're not getting their votes.

In short, politics is where ideals go to die.

When I was doing an internship two years ago, the city mayor visited our
office, to talk about the role of technology in governement.
During the Q&A session, an audience member asked how politicians could justify
switching positions so often. The mayor said that of course politicians are
going to act in a way that makes them popular with voters. Otherwise, they
wouldn't be keeping their constituents happy.

*Politicians are often forced to advocate for something they don't believe
in, because they need to be seen as caring about that issue.* Take Obama
on terrorism. In an interview with The Atlantic, he said that people get
much more scared of terrorism than they should. He'd prefer devoting his
time to forming stronger relationships with Asia, (check this.) But, he
couldn't be seen as soft on terror, and so he had to spend more time on
the Middle East than he wanted to.

It's all necessary to get the votes. Does it suck that politcians have to
pander for votes? I think it does suck. But what's the alternative?
If you don't pander for votes, someone who does pander for votes beats
you in the election. And remember, the whole reason you're a politician
is because you believe the people in charge are doing it wrong. The person
replacing you is going to do it wrong too.

Does it bother me, that politicians may be saying things they don't believe
in? Yes, it does. But that doesn't make me not want to vote for them, because
to me it shows they're good at playing the game.

Given these principles, what makes a politician appleaing to me? How do I
choose who to vote for?

People like to say that every vote counts, and if you don't vote, you don't have
a voice in the democracy. That's true, but it's so cliche that it's lost
the impact it deserves.

I think of votes like so: *votes are the means by which the public keeps
a politician's desire for power aligned with the public's interests.*
Yes, voting for a candidate gives them your support. But the flip side is also
true - not voting for a candidate punishes them into moving closer to
your position.

If a majority of the country agrees that interracial marriage shouldn't be
illegal and votes accordingly, it doesn't matter whether the politician
supports interracial marriage. If they speak out against it, they lose their
next election. That's it. There's no way out, for this hypothetical politician.

At some point, there's no difference between pandering to racists and being a
racist. And similarly, at some point there's no difference between pandering
to equal rights and believing in equal rights.

So there's one answer: vote for politicians who are closest to your personal
beliefs.

For me though, there's another metric: vote for politicians who look like
they'll actually get things done. Recall the golden rule of politics - no
one gets all of what they want.
