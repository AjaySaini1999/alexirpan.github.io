I'm not sure why you're here to get political opinions. When it comes to
discussing politics, I'm incredibly underqualified.

On the other hand, lots of people are underqualified, and that doesn't stop
flame wars on the Internet. And what, my understanding of politics is going
to get better if I try to avoid politics? That's literally the opposite
of what you should be doing if you want to understand politics.

Now, I still don't have a taste for politics, and I'm not interested in running
for office any time soon, but I figured that doesn't mean I can't get some quick
updates to my understanding.

So here's how this post is going to go. I explain how I model politicians. Then
people comment on things they feel aren't accurate. And that's it. No followup,
unless I want to write one. This is just an attempt to push my horizons.

\*\*\*

Politicians (people who run for public office) are motivated by two desires.

1. To get power, for the sake of having power.
2. To get power, for the sake of making the world a better place.

There are people who find great joy who find great joy in telling people what to do,
*and watching it actually happen.* Ever heard of a power trip? Now, imagine
you're this kind of person, and there's a job whose entire purpose is to create
laws that tell people what to do, and if they don't do it they get arrested.

The most cynical people would say that this is enough, and all of politics can
be reduced to people trying to get power for the sake of having power. However,
I think this is too big of a simplification. Many people want power because
they want the ability to exert meaningful change on the world. If you want
to convince people and have a role in shaping policy, politics isn't a bad
place to be.

In fact, the first step in making the world a better place is almost always
accumulating the power or influence to change people's minds. This can be
somewhat icky to admit out loud, but I have a very hard time denying them.

Power is my mistress. I have worked too hard at her conquest to allow anyone to take her away from me.

Politics isn't the only way to get power. In fact, I imagine it's a lot easier
to get power outside of public office rather than inside public office.
Somehow, it feels a lot easier to climb a corporate ladder than a government
ladder.

(As an aside, every politician is trying to make the world a better place.
It's just that they have different opinions on what an ideal world looks like.)

This view helps explain the role of elections. In an internship two years ago,
the city mayor visited our office to give a talk. During the Q&A session,
an audience member asked how politicians could justify switching positions so
often. The mayor said that of course politicians are going to act in a way
that makes them popular with voters. Otherwise, they wouldn't get to be
elected.

*In a democracy, votes are the ways to keep a politician's desire for power
aligned with your interests.* If you agree with one candidate more than the
other, you vote for the candidate you like more, because that rewards
candidates that follow your norms and punishes candidates that don't.

It's hard to understand how powerful this is. Everyone says that if you don't
vote, your voice won't be heard, but when you realize that you have the power
to punish politicians for being sexist, or racist, or pro-choice/pro-life, or
for denying/embracing climate change, and furthermore that they *have* to
change their mind, *even if they believe otherwise*, for the sake of keeping
elected office, you realize there's a power there. And you didn't have to
campaign for weeks to get it.
