I'm not sure why you're here to get political opinions. When it comes to
discussing politics, I'm incredibly underqualified.

On the other hand, lots of people are underqualified, and that doesn't stop
flame wars on the Internet. And what, my understanding of politics is going
to get better if I try to avoid politics? That's literally the opposite
of what you should be doing if you want to understand politics.

Now, I still don't have a taste for politics, and I'm not interested in running
for office any time soon, but I figured that doesn't mean I can't get some quick
updates to my understanding.

So here's how this post is going to go. I explain how I model politicians. Then
people comment on things they feel aren't accurate. And that's it. No followup,
unless I want to write one. This is just an attempt to push my horizons.

Politicians (people who run for public office) are motivated by two desires.

1. To get power, for the sake of having power.
2. To get power, for the sake of making the world a better place.

How important each of the two is comes down to both the politician and the level
of office they're running for. Someone running for town mayor is more likely to
be motivated by making the world a better place. Someone running for Senator
is closer towards the end of wanting more power. Someone running for President
almost certainly has power as their primary goal. Only a very, very interesting
sort of person would look at the Presidency, observe the incredible stress
it causes, consider the increased odds of death by assassination, and conclude
that yeah, they could run the United freaking States of America.

The most cynical people would claim that all politicians are entirely
self-motivated, doing whatever it takes to keep elected office. I don't think
that position is entirely wrong, and at the same time I don't think it's
entirely right. When I look at a politician, I see somebody who believes
world order is broken. The whole thesis of running for office is that you
believe you'd be a better leader than the current one, so of course
a politician wants power - the people in power are doing it wrong!

It's somewhat icky to admit out loud, but sometimes the first step to making
the world a better place is seizing enough power to influence other people's
minds.

And this should go without saying, but every politician is genuinely trying
to make the world a better place. It's just that they have wildly different
opinions on what an ideal world should look like. You don't devote hours to
fundraising and campaigning unless you truly believe some laws need to
change. If someone just wanted power, they'd probably have an easier time
getting power through the private sector.

The other golden rule of politics is that nobody gets everything of what they
want.

Governments are vast systems of incredible complexity. It's surprising that
they work at all, all things considered. That means there are large structural
forces that prevent people from doing "the right thing."

The President has a lot of power, but the President isn't a dictator.
Similarly, a Congressman or Congresswoman is just one person in the House of
Representatives. Everyone has their pet issue, and they're not all going to get
addressed, because some of those pet issues will be in direct conflict to one
another.

Politicians have to balance their personal convictions with the realities of
the system. If you Stick to your guns and refuse to make concessions, you
don't get anywhere. Look at what happened to Congress last administration.

Furthermore, everyone knows this. People liked to complain about Republicans
blocking Democratic legislation by being obstinate, but it made sense. Stall
the legislative process, make voters disillusioned by Democratice leadership,
and win back control of the House in midterm elections. And Democrats know
this, so they either had to make bigger concessions, or had to paint
Republicans as do-nothings to hurt their election chances.

The point is that politics is messy, meandering, filled with off the record
deals, and you have to learn to navigate this whole mess, or else you're
not the leader you promised the voters you were going to be. And if you
don't deliver, you're not getting their votes.

In short, politics is where ideals go to die.

When I was doing an internship two years ago, the city mayor visited our
office, to talk about the role of technology in governement.
During the Q&A session, an audience member asked how politicians could justify
switching positions so often. The mayor said that of course politicians are
going to act in a way that makes them popular with voters. Otherwise, they
wouldn't be keeping their constituents happy.

*Politicians are often forced to advocate for something they don't believe
in, because they need to be seen as caring about that issue.* Take Obama
on terrorism. In an interview with The Atlantic, he said that people get
much more scared of terrorism than they should. He'd prefer devoting his
time to forming stronger relationships with Asia, (check this.) But, he
couldn't be seen as soft on terror, and so he had to spend more time on
the Middle East than he wanted to.

*In a democracy, votes are the ways to keep a politician's desire for power
aligned with your interests.* If you agree with one candidate more than the
other, you vote for the candidate you like more, because that rewards
candidates that follow your norms and punishes candidates that don't.

It's hard to understand how powerful this is. Everyone says that if you don't
vote, your voice won't be heard, but when you realize that you have the power
to punish politicians for being sexist, or racist, or pro-choice/pro-life, or
for denying/embracing climate change, and furthermore that they *have* to
change their mind, *even if they believe otherwise*, for the sake of keeping
elected office, you realize there's a power there. And you didn't have to
campaign for weeks to get it.
