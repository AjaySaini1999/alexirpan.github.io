For once, Sean is happy on a Monday morning.

It's hard for Sean to get happy on Mondays. He works in one of the basement
labs at ExGen's headquarters. There are no windows. The ceiling lights are stuck
at a perpetual pale yellow. It's a perfect storm for destroying Circadian rhythms,
and the hours can be long and dreary.
Yes, he gets to work at the frontier of genetics
research, but it's hard work, and with such a homogenous architecture it's
very easy for a dinosaur to lose track of the time.

Sean is a stegosaurus. He stands at 2.5 meters tall, 8.5 meters long. He's
pretty sure his plates are still good. The doctor said they were at his last
physical, right before he went to college. That would be...just over six
years ago.

He's happy because today is his 1-year anniversary at ExGen. It's symbolic, but
frankly he doesn't care about company loyalty or what have you.
Sean cares because now that he's worked for a year, he's allowed to interact
with the humans directly.

The story is a simple one.

A long time ago, an expedition to the South Pole discovered a group of
remarkably well preserved humans. Most human skeletons found were charred,
irradiated, and decomposed almost beyond identification. This - this was a
gold mine for anthropology.

With great care, the researchers extracted several tissue samples. By analyzing
them, they greatly improved their understanding of human biology.
And then the ethics questions began.

"Why don't we bring them back? Human artifacts accelerated our technology curve.
We owe it to them."

"Why should we bring back a species that caused its own extinction? The humans
you want to thank died long ago. Leave your sentiments at the door, it's a
gross waste of resources."

"Going to the South Pole was a gross waste of resources too. So was recreating
the Apollo 11 capsule. But we did it anyways, for the same reasons as them, and
several centuries ahead of schedule. You know why? Because they made mistakes
that we didn't have to. *We owe them.*"

The debate was heated, but eventually the community came to a consensus. Bring
them back. A small community, no more, then see where it goes.
