For once, Sean is happy on a Monday morning.

It's hard for Sean to get happy on Mondays. He works in one of the basement
labs at ExGen's headquarters. There are no windows. The ceiling lights are stuck
at a perpetual pale yellow. It's a perfect storm for destroying Circadian rhythms,
and the hours can be long and dreary.
Yes, he gets to work at the frontier of genetics
research, but it's hard work, and with such a homogenous architecture it's
very easy for a dinosaur to lose track of the time.

Sean is a stegosaurus. He stands at 2.5 meters tall, 8.5 meters long. He's
pretty sure his plates are still good. The doctor said they were at his last
physical, right before he went to college. That would be...just over six
years ago.

He's happy because today is his 1-year anniversary at ExGen. It's symbolic, but
frankly he doesn't care about company loyalty or what have you. Sean cares
because he is now officially certified to talk with the humans.
