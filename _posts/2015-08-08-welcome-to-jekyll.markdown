Let's start with a story.

A long, long time ago (around 1 year, 3 months ago to be exact), some dude registered
a personal domain and set up a blog using Blogger. (TODO add link.) He did this with
the express purpose of learning to write better, because his writing was terrible
and it wasn't going to get any better without having a place to share it. He then
proceeded to write two technical, dry posts about using Amazon Web Services
credit to mine Litecoins, and never posted anything again.

That dude was obviously me. Let's take it to the present day. I've got things
I want to say, and although my default of using Facebook as a blogging platform
works surprisingly well, it's harder to do formatting, and some posts require more
permanence.

If that was the only consideration, I could have used Facebook Notes, but I've
also been looking for an opportunity to move my personal site off the default Blogger
template. After looking around a bit, I've settled on using Jekyll (TODO also add this link)
and Github Pages. There's a couple of reasons I'm doing this.

- Blogger felt too heavyweight for what I wanted. All I'm looking for is the
bare minimum in framework and styling
    - Blogger's site templating is great for getting started quickly, but it
      abstracts most of the details. With Jekyll, it's much easier to follow
      how my site gets generated. There's no WYSIWYG editor, but I can read
      unrendered Markdown well enough.
- With Github Pages, I don't need to worry about paying for web hosting.
- The site is backed by a git repo (ADD LINK). I get backups for free. I get
branches for free. I get edit history for free. If I want to, I can literally
go through my commits and get insights into my writing process.
    - This is what sold me on Jekyll; having complete draft history is beautiful
      for retrospectives. To be honest, I suspect I'll never use it, but it's good
      to have the option.

In short, Jekyll lets me write blog posts with little overhead and great transparency.
The two posts from my old blog have been ported over, you should see them if you
scroll down. Out with the old, in with the new...

As for next steps, I'm trying to avoid falling into the same trap of having no
content, so I'm going to explicitly set some ground rules for myself.
- This will not be a technical blog, although I may make posts on technical topics.
  I don't have enough material to make only technical posts. Also, I do actually
  have interests besides math and programming (which is a slight miracle in itself.)
- I will write posts about whatever I feel like, and not give a shit about whether
  it's worth sharing or not.

(BAD TRANSITION. MAKE A BETTER ONE)

So far, I have two posts I'm planning to write. One involves reviewing fanfiction.
The other involves a webcomic. I have proto-ideas for a few other posts, which may
or may not see the light of day.

As for the title - I don't consider myself to be insightful yet. But if I try,
maybe I can get there. Hopefully, you'll come with me on the ride.
