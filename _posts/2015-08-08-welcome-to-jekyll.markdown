Let's start with a story.

A long, long time ago (around 1 year, 3 months ago to be exact), some dude registered
a personal domain and set up a blog using Blogger. (TODO add link.) He did this with
the express purpose of learning to write better, because his writing was terrible
and it wasn't going to get any better without having a place to share it. He then
proceeded to write two technical, dry posts about using Amazon Web Services
credit to mine Litecoins, and never posted anything again.

That dude was obviously me. Let's take it to the present day. I've got things
I want to say, and although my default of using Facebook as a blogging platform
works surprisingly well, it's harder to do formatting, and some posts require more
permanence.

If that was the only consideration, I could have used Facebook Notes, but I've
also been looking for an opportunity to move my personal site off the default Blogger
template. After looking around a bit, I've settled on using Jekyll (TODO also add this link)
and Github Pages. There's a couple of reasons I'm doing this
    - Blogger felt too heavyweight for what I wanted. All I'm looking for is the
    bare minimum in framework and styling
    - Although it isn't fluent, I'm getting to the point where I can read
    unrendered Markdown, so losing a WYSIWYG editor is fine.
    - With Github Pages, I don't need to worry about paying for web hosting.
    - The site is backed by a git repo (ADD LINK). I get backups for free. I get
    branches for free. I get edit history for free. If I want to, I can literally
    go through my commits and get insights into my writing process. This is what
    sold me on Jekyll; having complete draft history is beautiful for writing
    retrospectives. To be honest, I suspect I'll never use it, but it's good
    to have the option.

In short, Jekyll lets me write blog posts like a programmer, with little overhead
and simple functionality.
