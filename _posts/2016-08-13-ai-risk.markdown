*These are my personal opinions, and do not reflect the opinions of
anybody I've worked with. AI risk is a touchy subject, so I want to
be very clear about this.*

I went to Effective Altruism Global this year, which was pretty great.
I wasn't sure I would fit into the effective altruist culture, since I
didn't count myself as part of EA, but it turns out I do fit in, and
EA attracts a lot of interesting people.

Now, I'm bad at starting conversation, but starting conversation at
EA Global is easy. All you have to do is ask what they do. And that
led to the following exchange, which I probably repeated about 10 times
over the entire weekend.

> Them: "What do you do?"
>
> Me: "Well, I just finished my undergrad at Berkeley. I'm now working
> at Google Brain, a machine learning research group."
>
> Them: "That's really cool! So, just wondering...(what's your opinion
> on the existential risk on AI/what's your timeline for AGI)?"
