Turns out the secret to getting more blog posts out of me is to
*royally piss me off*.

There'a [a viral video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFxFRqNmXKg)
claiming Google manipulated search results in favor of Hillary.
I've seen several people watch this and say, "Yeah, seems likely."
In constrast, my reaction was to laugh at the video, and I did,
before I found out how many people believed it. Then I was just mad.

I'm going to regret this, but here's why this video is
horseshit.


The Argument
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The creators of the linked video did some searches when working
on a report concluding presidential primaries, and made an observation.
The autocomplete suggestions Google suggested for Hillary were different
from Yahoo's and Bing's suggestions. The suggestions were for terms that
were searched less often than the ones suggested by Yahoo and Bing, and
also had more positive sentiment.
In contrast, the autocompletes tried for Sanders and Trump seemed to
match.

The video then points out the relationship between Hillary and Eric
Schmidt, to give Google a motive for biasing search results.


My Rebuttal
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, here's some autocomplete results from Snopes.

These results suggest that when there is more uncertainty in what
search the user is making, Google biases towards a more positive result.
This is something that holds across all candidates, not just Hillary.
Note this is **not** the same as Google always having positive search
results. It simply means that the system is less sure how to complete
"Hillary Clinton cri" than it is on how to complete "Bernie Sanders so".
If you're typing "Bernie Sanders so", it's pretty likely you're going to
complete it to "socialist", since Sanders self-identifies as a democratic
socialist. On the other hand, it's less clear that "Bernie Sanders com"
will complete to "communist" since it's a rarer phrase, and that's where
the positivity bias comes in. This was confirmed by a public statement from Google.

Okay
