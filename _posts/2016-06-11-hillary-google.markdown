Turns out the secret to getting more blog posts out of me is to
*royally piss me off*.

There'a [a viral video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFxFRqNmXKg)
claiming Google manipulated search results in favor of Hillary.
I've seen several people watch this and say, "Yeah, seems likely."
In constrast, my reaction was to laugh at the video, and I did,
before I found out how many people believed it. Then I was just mad.

I may regret this, but here's why I find the whole affair preposterous.


The Argument
--------------------------------------------------------

The creators of the linked video did some searches when working
on a report concluding presidential primaries, and made an observation.
The autocomplete suggestions Google suggested for Hillary were different
from Yahoo's and Bing's suggestions. The suggestions were for terms that
were searched less often than the ones suggested by Yahoo and Bing, and
also had more positive sentiment.
In contrast, the autocompletes tried for Sanders and Trump seemed to
match.

The video then points out the relationship between Hillary and Eric
Schmidt, to give Google a motive for biasing search results.


My Rebuttal
-----------------------------------------------------------

Autocompletes are Not Biased Just for Hillary
==========================================================

![Other search results](/public/hillary-google/searches.jpg)
{: .centered }

These results suggest that when there is more uncertainty in what
search the user is making, Google biases towards a more positive result.
This is something that holds across all candidates, not just Hillary.
Note this is **not** the same as Google always having positive search
results. It simply means that the system is less sure how to complete
"Hillary Clinton cri" than it is on how to complete "Bernie Sanders so".
If you're typing "Bernie Sanders so", it's pretty likely you're going to
complete it to "socialist", since Sanders self-identifies as a democratic
socialist. On the other hand, it's less clear that "Bernie Sanders com"
will complete to "communist" since it's a rarer phrase, and that's where
the positivity bias comes in. This was confirmed by a public statement from Google.


It Would Be Too Difficult to Hide The Conspiracy
============================================================

Let's set aside motive. Because actually, I don't give a shit about the motive,
and the motive has nothing to do with why I don't believe this video.
A good motive increases the likelihood a
person does something, but it does nothing towards explaining the logistics
that go into it.

So to play devil's advocate, let's set aside motive, and assume Google has
been manipulating search results in favor of Hillary. In such a world,
what also has to be true?

Such a bias had to have been added in by an engineer. That biasing code
made it past code review. No one on the entire Search team (which is about
200 engineers) noticed this, or anyone who did decided to stay quiet.
Note Bernie Sanders outraised Hillary Clinton in Silicon Valley, so it's
not like the whole company -Hillary. There is a sizable Bernie contingent
who would report such a thing, if it actually existed.

Let me state this again for emphasis: **if the conspiracy is true, then
none of those 200 engineers reported it, despite having direct access
to Google's codebase. And, despite a sizable fraction of them being
Bernie supporters. AND, despite them knowing search very well because
_it is their literal full-time job._**

I find this so incredibly preposterous that I can't believe it to be true.

It doesn't matter that Eric Schmidt has dealt with Hillary, because we're
assuming the conspiracy is real for the sake of argument. Motives alone
are not enough to justify a conspiracy.


The Timing Suggests More Reasonable Explanations
=============================================================

This is the third nail in the coffin for me. I don't even need this, because
I only need to cast reasonable doubt to explain why a theory is bogus. But
just for kicks, here's my take on things.

The video claims the conspiracy was so subtle that they only realized it
right now. That's possible, but the coincidence that they noticed it
right after it's impossible to do anything about it doesn't fit well
with me. They claim they discovered this behavior when doing searches for
a report wrapping up the presidential primaries - so why didn't they discover
it for previous Super Tuesdays?

Here's what I think happened: while Bernie had a plausible chance, the creators
of this video focused their brainpower on figuring out ways Bernie could
still win. Once Bernie lost in California, they subconsciously focused on
finding reasons Bernie *deserved* to win. Because that's how the narrative goes!
The system is corrupt, it's fighting against the One True Candidate at every
turn. The narrative made people susceptible to ballooning a small difference in
search results into the claim that Google systematically biased for Hillary,
and the narrative didn't make them question if their evidence was strong
enough for their claim.

This is symptomatic of a trend I've noticed among the most intolerable Bernie
supporters. They have been grasping at the tiniest straws to argue why Bernie
is going to be the nominee, as if the only reason Bernie lost was because
of "the establishment", the mythical body that has enough power to make the
candidate of their choice. You know, the same establishment that backed Jeb,
and Rubio, who are both leading nominees. OH WAIT.

Look. I like Bernie. He has ideas I like. The majority of Bernie supporters
I've interacted with are reasonable people who don't let their love of the
candidate blind themselves from the reality of politics.
