title:  "Six Months of Blogging: A Retrospective"
date:   2016-02-18 00:15:00 -0800
---

Just over six months ago, I [rebooted my personal site](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/08/18/hello-world-again.html)
and started blogging.

It's a milestone, of sorts, and the part of me that loves all things meta
wouldn'tl forgive myself if I passed up the chance to blog about my blog.
I decided it would be neat to collect all the little things I've learned in
the past half year.

Github Pages Was A Good Call
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My main goal with the site reboot was to give myself a platform that
let me focus almost entirely on creating content. Github Pages fit perfectly.
Free web hosting, total control over my site's content,
a transparent build process that lets me preview my site from my laptop,
and free edit history and backups thanks to Git.

I know it's incredibly nerdy to say this, but getting to write my blog posts
with Vim makes is fantastic. So far, I have image files, audio files, code
highlighting, Youtube embeds, spoiler buttons, and typeset math (implemented with [KaTeX](http://khan.github.io/KaTeX/)).
Not only does it all work, I know exactly how it all works, because none
of the functionality is abstracted away.

The only weird bug I've run into is a conflict between
[KaTeX and kramdown](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX/issues/20#issuecomment-133649914),
but even that wasn't terrible. After figuring out the issue, I could
[add a hotfix](https://github.com/alexirpan/alexirpan.github.io/commit/bb00924acd5e1e1c5fbca8fd25847058f1d9ad1c) myself.
(Please don't ask how the regex works. It just does.)



Writing Takes Even Longer Than I Imagined
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I never planned to have an update schedule. If I had one, I knew I'd fall behind,
and would feel obligated to write something even when I didn't have the time
or ideas.

I knew that meant my updates would be sporadic, but I didn't expect how much
time I needed for each post. Without
fail, every post I write takes longer to finish than I think it will.
And for the record, I've tried to remember planning fallacy from day one.
Every post, I give myself a generous estimate, and *overshoot it anyways.*
As Douglas Hofstadter puts it,

> Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.

(*GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach*)
{: .centered}

Proving Hofstadter's Law wouldn't be so bad if I didn't do most of my blogging
around midnight. I have definitely lost sleep to blogging, and that can't be
healthy. To show how bad this can be, let's look at the commits for
my [first technical post](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/08/23/simulating-a-biased-coin-with-a-fair-one.html).

* Initial work saved Thursday, 2 AM
* Completed a first draft Friday night, working from 9 PM to midnight.
* Revising session Saturday night. Started at 11 PM, hoping to finish by 2 AM.
Ended up revising until *3:40 AM*.
* Final proofreading and launch Sunday evening. Attempt to fix my sleep
schedule for Monday fails miserably.

You'd think I'd have learned to schedule writing time elsewhere,
but I haven't. In fact, I'm doing some late night writing right now.
Check the commits for this post. You should find a commit at 1 AM,
another at 2 AM, a few 3 AM commits mixed in...

This procrastination is even worse for my longer posts. My post
[about my thoughts on graduate school](
http://www.alexirpan.com/2016/01/03/grad-school.html) was
written during a month of winter break.
Like all good programmers, I express my rage through commit messages,
and wow are there some gems here.

> More things. All the things. man whose going to read these commits anyways (Sat Dec 19 03:36:46 2015)

> Time to in medias res this shit up (Sat Dec 26 16:50:37 2015)

> Too lazy to make good commit message (Sun Jan 3 18:28:00 2016)

> URGH JUST SHIP IT. (Sun Jan 10 11:50:03 2016)

(Incidentally, this is why you should consider a [CFAR workshop](http://rationality.org/workshops/).
Reading about logical fallacies doesn't stop you from making them.
I haven't done one because the cost is scary, but I've thought about it.)


Time Is The Limiting Factor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the past 6 months, I've written fourteen posts. Fifteen, if you count this one.
That averages to just over one post every 2 weeks.

It turns out I have blog-worthy ideas more often than twice a week.
When I started this, I was worried I'd run out of things to say, but
the opposite has turned true. I have so many posts I want to write, and
don't have the time to do so.

I consider myself a slow person in all aspects of life. I rarely solve a problem
at first glance, and rely on putting in tons of hours for my problem sets.
I almost never ask questions in lecture,
because I rarely know enough to articulate exactly what I'm confused about.
And when it comes to writing, I have to phrase an idea once in the head
and thrice on the page before I'm satisfied.

It baffles me that [web serials](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) and blogs
like [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/) update at least once a week,
because I can't do that. I'm too sloppy and undisciplined with my time.

I think people undervalue how impressive sticking to a schedule is. We'd all
be a lot better off if we [valorized organization more](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/09/01/optimizing-process.html).


Blogging Isn't Special, But People Who Don't Think Differently
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAKE A BETTER HEADING TITLE

Occasionally, people have praised my writing, or thanked me for sharing my
viewpoint, or called me special. I'm honored, and I'm very proud of some of my
posts, but from my perspective it's not that impressive. Plenty of people I know
have interesting ideas, many much better than mine, and the only difference is
that I've shared mine in a blog post instead of over beer at someone's house.

> Everybody has a secret world inside of them. All of the

> wonderful, stupid, amazing worlds. Not just one world. Hundreds of them.
> Thousands maybe.

(Neil Geiman, *The Sandman*)
{: .centered }

People think they're boring.

They think they're nothing special, that their lives are cookie cutter.
They think their perspectives are mainstream and interests are dull.

*But nothing could be further from the truth.*

Everybody's interesting. Everybody's cool. It's just hard to see, because
it's hidden behind layers of pleasantries and fear of judgment and ridicule.

We've all got our own brand of stupidity, and it's worth sharing.
It's a wonderfully naive, goofy, idealistic viewpoint, and I own the hell
out of it. I've got the rest of my life to become a cynical old man.
Why should I try to get there any faster?


I Actually Have A Writing Style
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I deliberately chose to keep this blog colloquial. It's my blog, it's my
voice, and I don't give a shit about formal writing conventions. If
I want to use contractions or swear a bit, I will. If my posts drag on,
that's part of who I am.

I don't want to feel obligated to write a certain way, or write only about
certain things. I write things I think I'll want to read later.
If anyone else thinks that's cool, it's a bonus.

Throwing off the shackles of formal voice made it much easier
to produce content, but I've also found an unintended side effect.
Once I tried to [write like how I'd talk if I had the time to phrase things
just right](http://paulgraham.com/talk.html), I started noticing patterns.
I start many sentences with "and" or "but" or "because", the abruptness
of the conjunction is neat. I say "A and B and C"
instead of the more correct "A, B, and C", the missing commas make
it flow quicker.

I adopted one to two sentence paragraphs.
They're very good when you want to emphasize ideas with force.

I add parallel structure wherever I can. It's simple, it's straightforward,
and it's an easy way to make disparate ideas seem connected.

It's very cool that I can notice these things, because getting better at
writing was my main goal with blogging.
But, it also means I have to spend lots of time revising.
If I'm not careful, all my sentences will start with contractions. Every
paragraph will have shoehorned parallelism.
Words will repeat, sentences will be structured similarly, my writing
will become dull and laggard.

I can recognize good writing. The hard part is actually making it.


Experience, Not Effort, Is The Biggest Factor In Quality
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This one surprised me. Consider two posts, one about [Doctor Whooves Adventures](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/09/24/how-an-audio-play-about-a-time-traveling-pony-turned-me-into-a-fanboy.html),
and the other about [AlphaGo](http://www.alexirpan.com/2016/01/28/deepmind-go.html).

The first was very difficult for me to write. I didn't know why I liked
*Doctor Whooves Adventures*, and even after writing about it I find it hard
to explain why I still rewatch old episodes. Over two weeks, I
agonized on how to express my love for the show, on what to spoil and
what to keep a surprise. Eventually, I posted a final draft to a lukewarm response.

In comparison, the post on AlphaGo was written in a single night.
I wanted to strike while the iron was hot, since I knew interest in Go would be
fleeting.
Thanks to prior experience with the research areas involved, I got the gist of
the paper on a single read. and thanks to thinking about these
topics for over a year, I was able to quickly articulate my feelings on the
result.

When I review my past work, almost all of my favorite posts are technical
ones. It's what I have the most experience writing. I've been writing
proofs since high school, gave a math talk in 11th grade, and did two research
presentations last semester. *Of course my technical posts are going to be better
than my non-technical ones, I've had years of practice.*

Writing is the process of turning ideas into words. It's a lot easier
if you've seen and explained these ideas before.

That's not saying all my non-technical writing is bad. My finest work is
still [grad school post](http://www.alexirpan.com/2016/01/03/grad-school.html),
which was a pure non-technical thinkpiece. (Seriously, go read it if you
haven't. I doubt I'll ever write anything better.)

As with all things, I can do it if I put in enough time. The only question
is whether I can allocate enough time, and whether I want to.


Peer Review Is Amazing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On most posts, I don't ask friends to read them first. I've been
trying to practice my revision skills, and it feels like cheating to outsource
it to other people.

However, on some posts I decide it's worth it.
I've sent drafts out for three posts:
[The Other Two Envelope Problem](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/09/09/the-other-two-envelope-problem.html),
["How Do You Feel About Grad School?"](http://www.alexirpan.com/2016/01/03/grad-school.html),
and [A Gentle Introduction to Secure Computation](http://www.alexirpan.com/2016/02/11/secure-computation.html)

Every post got much better with their feedback, by an order of magnitude.

Nobody questions that peer review is helpful, but it's
hard to describe how much it helps. It's impossible
to recreate the first impression, and after reading so many drafts the sentences
blur together in your brain. You miss the forest for the trees, and need
someone else to look from further away.

Even the best writers send drafts to editors and friends. There's no shame in
it. What's more surprising is how little I valued this process before now.
It's something I had to go through many times to fully appreciate.


Popularity Is More About Exposure Than Quality
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to Google Analytics, my most viewed posts are:

* A Gentle Introduction to Secure Computation
* "How Do You Feel About Grad School?"
* Mystery Hunt 2016 Wrap-Up

Yet I know for sure that this isn't related to their quality.
The high view count comes almost entirely from sharing to a wider audience.

* I submitted the post on secure computation to Hacker News. It made front page,
and stuck there for a day.
* I also submitted the post on graduate school to Hacker News. That one didn't
stick, but it hung around new submissions for a while.
* Finally, I shared my Mystery Hunt write-up to the Mystery Hunt subreddit.

Traffic to my blog is almost entirely decided by whether I share it
ouside Facebook. By my rankings, my AlphaGo post and [Khan Academy](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/08/20/things-i-did-in-my-khan-academy-internship.html)
post deserve more views.

I know it's obvious, but it bears repeating: **popular things are not always good, and
good things are not always popular.** I'm a bit obsessed with refreshing my
blog analytics, more than is healthy, and I need to remember to divorce my
feelings about a post from its view count.


Writing More Is Helping
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of my four most recent posts, not counting this one, three are in the running
for my personal favorites. It's not a coincidence.

I've heard everybody cringes when they read their past writing, and I'm no
exception. Almost every post has something I'd change if I got another chance,
but if I started going down that road, I'd spend my whole time endlessly
tweaking sentences. About the only post I'm okay with is my post about
grad school. (Oddly enough, I'm almost okay with
[Retrospective on Friendship is Magic Season 5](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/11/29/mlp-season-5-review.html).
It must be too short to offend me.

The Next Six Months
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I plan to write more non-technical posts, to stretch those parts of my brain.
Off the top of my head, I still need to write about *Gunnerkrigg Court*,
effort icebergs, and obsessive fandoms. I may also try some short form
creative writing, there are some interesting ideas I want to explore.
(On the short list is an idea inspired by a quote from *Fine Structure*:
"There was a war in Heaven, and the debris fell to Earth.")

Ideally, I'll have more free time this semester because it's my final one,
but it's not clear that'll be true. I'll also be working full time starting
in June. So, although my goal is to write more, don't be surprised if this
doesn't happen.

MAKE AN ENDING
