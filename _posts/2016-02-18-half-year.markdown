title:  "Six Months of Blogging: A Retrospective"
date:   2016-02-18 00:15:00 -0800
---

Just over six months ago, I [rebooted my personal site](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/08/18/hello-world-again.html)
and started blogging. Half a year seemed like a good milestone to do a retrospective.
Besides, the part of me that loves all things meta wouldn't forgive myself if I
missed a chance for a self-referential blog post.

\*\*\*
{: .centered }

When I started blogging, I had three goals.

* Give myself a platform that let me focus almost entirely on creating content,
ideally with as much transparency as possible.
* Use that platform to write technical posts about anything I thought was
interesting.
* Also use that platform to improve my non-technical writing, by writing
about the shows and comics I liked.

So far, I've done well on the first two and not so well on the last.
I wasn't expecting my blog to be so scattered - it's not quite a technical
blog and not quite a non-technical one, it just is. I guess that's the
consequence of treating my blog as a more polished version of my thoughts.


Github Pages Was A Good Call
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's admittedly barebones, but Github Pages has been a wonderful platform
for my personal site. Free web hosting, total control over my site's content,
a transparent build process that lets me preview my site without an
internet connection, and complete edit history thanks to Git. I know it's
incredibly nerdy to say this, but getting to write my blog posts in
Markdown using vim is amazing.

After the upfront cost of getting my site working, writing all of my posts
and adding new functionality has been straightforward. As of now, I have
image files, audio files, syntax highlighting, Youtube embeds, spoiler buttons,
and KaTeX enabled. Not only does it all work, I know exactly how it all
works, since none of the functionality is abstracted away into plugins. It's
all handrolled.

The only weird bug I've run into is a conflict between
[KaTeX and kramdown](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX/issues/20#issuecomment-133649914),
but even that wasn't terrible.
Since I had control over the site content, I could
[add a hotfix](https://github.com/alexirpan/alexirpan.github.io/commit/bb00924acd5e1e1c5fbca8fd25847058f1d9ad1c) myself.
(Please don't ask how the regex works, it just does.)



Writing Takes Even Longer Than I Imagined
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As someone who's struggled with essays his whole life, I had no plans to
even attempt an update schedule. If I had one, I knew I either wouldn't make it
or would feel obligated to write something even when I didn't have good ideas.

What I didn't expect was that when I did decide to write a post, it would
always, always take longer to finish than I thought it would. And for the record,
I knew about planning fallacy from day one. On every post, I gave myself leeway,
and I *still overhot it.* As Douglas Hofstadter puts it,

> Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.

(*GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach*)
{: .centered}

Running into Hofstadter's Law again and again wouldn't be so bad if my most
productive blogging hours weren't at night. As it stands, I get most of
writing done around midnight. To show how bad this can been, let's look at my
[first technical post](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/08/23/simulating-a-biased-coin-with-a-fair-one.html).
Pulling up the timestamps of all my Git commits gives this.

If you read carefully, you can see the hours of lost sleep

* Initial work saved at Thursday, 2 AM
* First draft of words and diagrams done Friday night, from 9 PM to midnight.
* Revising session on Saturday Night, starting at 11 PM and ending at
*3:40 AM*.
* Final proofreading and launch on Sunday evening. Attempt to fix my sleep
schedule in time for Monday fails miserably.

You'd think I'd have learned my lesson, but sadly I haven't.
In fact, I'm doing something similar right now. Check the commit history for
this post, you'll find a commit at 1 AM. No way I'm going to be awake for
my morning classes...

It's worse for my larger posts. My [post on my feelings towards graduate school](
http://www.alexirpan.com/2016/01/03/grad-school.html) was written over a month
of winter break. Like all good programmers, I express my rage through commit logs,
and wow, there are some gems here.

> More things. All the things. man whose going to read these commits anyways (Sat Dec 19 03:36:46 2015)

> Time to in medias res this shit up (Sat Dec 26 16:50:37 2015)

> Too lazy to make good commit message (Sun Jan 3 18:28:00 2016)

> Cut a paragraph from the email. Close to something I'm okay releasing, one more reread (Sat Jan 9 01:38:18 2016)

> Okay, more changes than I thought. Going to reread again (Sat Jan 9 22:55:00 2016)

> This post keeps getting longer and longer... (Sun Jan 10 02:48:04 2016)

> URGH JUST SHIP IT. (Sun Jan 10 11:50:03 2016)

(Incidentally, this is a good argument for why you should consider
a [CFAR workshop](http://rationality.org/workshops/) if you have the money.
You can read about logical fallacies all you want, it doesn't stop you from
making them. I haven't done one because the cost is scary and my
mind is stupidly stubborn about some things, but I've been thinking about it.)


Time Is The Limiting Factor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've written fourteen posts in the past 6 months. (Fifteen, if you count this
one.) That works out to about one post every 2 weeks.

When I started this blog, I was worried I wouldn't have things to say, but
the opposite has turned true; I have so many posts I'd like to create, and
don't have the time to turn them all into reality.

I consider myself a slow person, both in problem solving and writing.
I don't care what my grades say, it's very rare for me to figure out the right
approach likes others seem to do, and most of my success comes from brute force
instead of clever insight. I have to turn an idea once in the head and thrice on
the page before I'm satisfied with it.

It baffles me that [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/)
updates at least once a week. I'm confused by [web serials](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/)
that release new chapters like clockwork. I certainly can't do that.

I think people don't respect how impressive sticking to a schedule is. Or if
they do, they don't respect it enough.


Blogging Isn't Special, But People Who Don't Think Differently
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Occasionally, people have praised my writing, or thanked me for sharing my
viewpoint, or called me special. I'm honored, and I'm very proud of some of my
posts, but from my perspective it's not that impressive. Plenty of people I know
have interesting ideas, many much better than mine, and the only difference is
that I've shared mine in a blog post instead of over beer at someone's house.

> Everybody has a secret world inside of them. All of the

> Thousands maybe.

(Neil Geiman, *The Sandman*)
{. :centered }

People think they're boring.

They think they're nothing special, that their lives are cookie cutter.
They think their perspectives are mainstream and interests are dull.

*But nothing could be further from the truth.*

Everybody's interesting. Everybody's cool. It's just hard to see, because
it's hidden behind layers of pleasantries and fear of judgment and ridicule.

We've all got our own brand of stupidity, and it's worth sharing.
It's a wonderfully naive, goofy, idealistic viewpoint, and I own the hell
out of it. I've got the rest of my life to become a cynical old man.
Why should I try to get there any faster?


I Actually Have A Writing Style
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I made a deliberate choice to keep this blog colloquial. It's my blog. It's my
voice. I don't give a shit if people look down on me for using contractions
or swearing. I'll write about things I like in the way I like to read them, and
if anyone else cares, that's just a bonus.

It's made it much easier for me to produce content, but one unintended side
effect is that I've become more aware of my speech patterns.
I start lots of sentences with "and" or "but" because I like the abruptness of starting with
a conjnction. I abuse parallel structure because it's simple, it's straightforward,
and it's an easy way to link disparate ideas together. I've adopted one sentence
paragraphs because they're very good for pounding ideas with great force.

It's pretty cool, but it also means I have to spend lots of time revising.
If I'm not careful, my sentences will all start with "I" or "It's", or they'll
all be stuctured the same way, or I'll accidentally use an uncommon word in
two adjacent sentences, or a whole host of errors that subtly weaken my prose.
Hopefully I can avoid these traps in the future.


Experience, Not Effort, Is The Biggest Factor In Quality
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This one surprised me. My writing quality depends almost entirely on how well
I understand the ideas behind it.

Consider two posts, one about [Doctor Whooves Adventures](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/09/24/how-an-audio-play-about-a-time-traveling-pony-turned-me-into-a-fanboy.html),
and the other about [AlphaGo](http://www.alexirpan.com/2016/01/28/deepmind-go.html).

The first was very difficult for me to write. I didn't know why I liked
*Doctor Whooves Adventures*, and even after writing about it I find it hard
to articulate what makes the radio play so entertaining. Over two weeks, I
agonized on how to express why the show was so good, on what to spoil and
what not to spoil. Eventually, I posted my final draft to a lukewarm response.
On re-read, it's a weak post.

On the other hand, the post on AlphaGo was written in a single night.
I wanted to hit the hammer (CHECK) while it was hot. I've been writing proofs
since 9th grade, gave a math talk in 11th grade, and had just finished
TAing a discrete math course, so I had lots of experience explaining technical
material to unfamiliar audiences. I wrote a first draft, spent an hour revising
it, and released it next morning. It was one of my most popular posts, and
although it could be cleaned up, the core ideas are all there.

Writing is the process that turns ideas into words. It turns out it's a lot
easier if you already know how you want to express those ideas are. It's not
a coincidence that many of my better posts are technical explanations instead
of thinkpieces.

(REPHRASE)

Hopefully I'll get better at non-technical writing in the upcoming months.

(ADD TO THINGS HERE)


The Second Biggest Factor Is Peer Review
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've sent drafts for feedback on three posts: biasing a fair coin, my thoughts on
graduate school, and an introduction to secure computation. Every one got
astoundingly better.

I think this is something about writing that everyone knows is true, but it's
hard to describe how much it actually helps. The first impression is both
important and impossible to recreate. Eventually, the brain glazes over the
minor details, and gets set into its own interpretation of the sentences.

> I don't know what I think of it anymore, I've been staring at it for so long.
> I can't tell. I really can't tell if it's good or not. [... I] don't even
> see the mistakes anymore.

(Phil Fish, *Indie Game: The Movie*)
{: .centered }

Even the best writers send drafts to editors and friends. There's no shame in
it. In fact, it's more surprising that I didn't value peer review so
highly before now. Somehow, that concept didn't enter my brain until now.


Quality Doesn't Automatically Lead To Popularity
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to Google Analytics, my most popular posts are

* Secure Computation
* Grad School Thoughts
* Mystery Hunt 2016 Wrap-Up

However, the popularity is only loosely connected to the content

* I submitted the post on secure computation to Hacker News, and it was on
the front page for a day.
* I also submitted my graduate school post to Hacker News. That one didn't
stick, but it got very good traction among Facebook friends (who were almost
all in college and could relate to many of my thoughts.)
* And finally, I shared the Mystery Hunt post on the Mystery Hunt subreddit.

Right now, the viewership of my blog is almost entirely decided by whether I
share it outside Facebook or not. Alright, so what if I ignore that? All of
my blog posts are shared on my personal Facebook. By activity there,
my most popular posts are

* Grad School Thoughts
* Things I Did In My Khan Academy Internship
* Tie between Go: More Complicated Than Go Fish and Simulating a Biased Coin With A Fair One

And although this is closer to my standard of quality, I'd rank my Secure
Computation Post as better than my Khan Academy post.

Again, it's an obvious point, but popularity is driven by several factors
besides quality. I'm a bit stat obsessed about my blog, probably more than is
healthy, and I need to remember to judge posts by myself instead of by
view count.


Yes, Writing More Is Helping
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's not a coincidence that of my four most recent posts, three are in the running
for the best quality. I've heard everybody cringes when they read their past
writing, and I'm no exception; on almost every post I notice things I want to change.
About the only post I'm okay with is my post about grad school, and that's
because I've already looked at it for so long.

(oddly enough, Retrospective on Friendship is Magic Season 5 got close. It
must be too short for it to offend me too much.)


The Next Six Months
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I plan to write more non-technical posts, to stretch those parts of my brain.
Off the top of my head, I still need to write about *Gunnerkrigg Court*,
effort icebergs, and obsessive fandoms. I may also try some short form
creative writing, there are some interesting ideas I want to explore.
(On the short list is an idea inspired by a quote from *Fine Structure*:
"There was a war in Heaven, and the debris fell to Earth.")

Ideally, I'll have more free time this semester because it's my final one,
but it's not clear that'll be true. I'll also be working full time starting
in June. So, although my goal is to write more, don't be surprised if this
doesn't happen.

MAKE AN ENDING
