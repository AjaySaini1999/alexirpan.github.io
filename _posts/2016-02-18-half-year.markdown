title:  "Lessons Learned After Six Months of Blogging"

Just over six months ago, I [rebooted my personal site]({% post_url 2015-08-18-hello-world-again %})
and started blogging. So far, I've been pleasantly surprised at the response.
It's encouraging to know people like reading my own brand of
stupidity.

As celebration, I decided to reflect on the lessons I've learned.
The part of me that loves all things meta wouldn't forgive myself
if I skipped a chance to write a blog post about my blog.

# 1. Just Write. It'll Get Better

Of my four most recent posts, not counting this one, three are among my
favorites. That's not a coincidence.

If you're worried you can't write well, write anyways.
Everybody cringes when they read their past writing, me included.
It's all part of the process.

> The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pounds of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot — albeit a perfect one — to get an “A”. Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work-and learning from their mistakes — the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.”

Or said more succinctly,

# 2. Your Writing Environment Matters. Take The Time To Find One That Works For You

My old personal site ran on [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com). It worked,
but I quickly lost motivation to update it.
Blogger abstracts its functionality behind its own tools, and I got sick of it.
To create posts, I had to go to Blogger's site and write in
their Microsoft Word-esque editor. To change the site layout, I had to use
a drag and drop interface or edit raw HTML. Plus, all the tie-ins with Google+
were vaguely annoying.

In contrast, [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) has been a complete
joy. It's transparent. I have total control over my site's design. I
get free edit history thanks to Git.
I know it's incredibly nerdy to say this, but getting to write my blog posts
in Markdown using Vim is fantastic.

So far, my blog uses images, audio clips, code
highlighting, Youtube embeds, spoiler buttons, typeset math (from [KaTeX](http://khan.github.io/KaTeX/)),
comments (from [Disqus](https://disqus.com)), and analytics (from [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/)).
Not only does it all work, I know how it all works, which is a huge plus.

If you're familiar with Git, it's surprising how natural blogging in it feels.
I can switch between different drafts on a whim, and can move from coding to
blogging with ease if I need to take a break from debugging.
The only issue I've had so far is a conflict between
[KaTeX and the Markdown rendering engine](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX/issues/20#issuecomment-133649914),
but even that wasn't terrible. After figuring out the problem, I
[added a hotfix](https://github.com/alexirpan/alexirpan.github.io/commit/bb00924acd5e1e1c5fbca8fd25847058f1d9ad1c)
the same day.

**If you don't like your writing environment, you aren't going to write.**
There are lots of obstacles between having an idea and writing about it.
Your environment shouldn't be one of them.


# 3. It'll Take Longer Than You Think

I never planned to have an update schedule. As a student, I knew my work loads
could shoot up in an instant, and I didn't want to feel obligated to write
something when I didn't have the time to do it properly.

What I didn't expect was how *long* writing would take.
Without fail, every post I write takes longer to
finish than I think it will. This is even after accounting for the
planning fallacy. As said by Douglas Hofstadter,

> Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.

(from *Gödel, Escher, Bach*)
{: .centered}

Proving Hofstadter's Law wouldn't be so bad if I didn't do most of my writing
at midnight. To show why it's awful, here are the commits for
my [first technical post]({% post_url 2015-08-23-simulating-a-biased-coin-with-a-fair-one %}).

* Initial work saved Thursday, 2 AM
* Completed a first draft Friday night, working from 9 PM to midnight.
* Revising session Saturday night. Started at 11 PM, hoping to finish by 2 AM.
Ended up revising until *3:40 AM*.
* Final proofreading and launch Sunday evening. Attempted to fix my sleep
schedule for Monday, failed miserably.

I have literally lost sleep to blogging. It's silly, it's stupid, and I
don't see it changing anytime soon. In fact, I'm doing some late night writing right now.
Check the commits for this post. You should find a commit at 1 AM,
another at 2 AM, a few 3 AM commits mixed in...

It's okay to get frustrated at your writing speed. Everyone wishes they could
write it well the first time, but no one does. Try not to let it bother you,
and keep going. I find that taking my rage out in commit messages helps.

> More things. All the things. man whose going to read these commits anyways (Sat Dec 19 03:36:46 2015)

> Time to in medias res this shit up (Sat Dec 26 16:50:37 2015)

> Too lazy to make good commit message (Sun Jan 3 18:28:00 2016)

> URGH JUST SHIP IT. (Sun Jan 10 11:50:03 2016)

Incidentally, this is why you should consider a [CFAR workshop](http://rationality.org/workshops/).
Reading about logical fallacies doesn't actually stop you from making them.
I haven't done one because the cost is scary, but I've considered it.


# 4. Don't Worry About Your Ideas. Worry About Your Time

In the past 6 months, I've written fourteen posts. Fifteen, if you count this one.
That averages to just over one post every 2 weeks.

I have blog-worthy ideas more often than once every 2 weeks.
When I started this, I was worried I'd run out of things to say, but
the opposite has turned true; I have too many ideas, and need to filter them
aggressively.

I consider myself a slow person in all aspects of life.
I rarely solve a problem at first glance, unless I've seen a problem that's
very very similar. I almost never ask questions in lecture,
because I'm usually so lost I can't articulate what I'm confused about.
And when it comes to writing, I have to phrase an idea once in the head
and thrice on the page before I'm satisfied.

Being slow isn't bad, but it baffles me that web serials like [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/)
and blogs like [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/) can update over once
a week. I certainly can't do that. It requires a level of discipline I don't
have yet.

I think people undervalue how impressive sticking to a schedule is. We'd all
be a lot better off if we [valorized organization more]({% post_url 2015-09-01-optimizing-process %}).


# 5. Your Writing Style Is Your Speaking Style. Embrace It

When I started this blog, I chose to keep it colloquial. It's my blog, and
it's my voice. If I want to use contractions or swear a bit, I will, formal
writing conventions be damned. If my posts drag on, that's part of who I
am, I won't change it.

I don't want to feel obligated to write a certain way, or present only certain
parts about myself. I write things I'll want to read later.
If other people read them too, that's cool.

Once I started [writing like how I'd talk if I had the time to phrase things
just right](http://paulgraham.com/talk.html), I started noticing patterns.
I start sentences with "and" or "but" or "because", since I like
the abruptness of the conjunction. I say "A and B and C"
instead of "A, B, and C" occasionally, because sometimes I don't
like the mental pauses from commas.

I adopted sudden paragraph breaks, since they're very good for emphasizing
specific sentences. I insert parallel structure everywhere, since it's an easy way
to connect disparate ideas.

When you write, you're trying to say something. So actually **say it**. Don't
couch it in formal writing. If that means you add Internet memes
everywhere, then so be it.

There's a time and place for formal writing. Blog posts are neither the time
nor the place.


# 6. Do Peer Review Whenever You Can

I usually don't ask friends to read my posts before I share them. I've been
practicing my revision skills, and it feels like cheating to outsource
it to other people.

However, sometimes I decide I want more polish.
I've asked for feedback on three posts:
[The Other Two Envelope Problem]({% post_url 2015-09-09-the-other-two-envelope-problem %}),
["How Do You Feel About Grad School?"]({% post_url 2016-01-03-grad-school %}),
and [A Gentle Introduction to Secure Computation]({% post_url 2016-02-11-secure-computation %})

Every post improved by an order of magnitude.

It's hard to describe how much peer review helps.
After reading so many drafts, your brain starts blurring the words together.
You miss the forest for the trees, and getting another viewpoint helps
untangle this.

Even the best writers send drafts to editors and friends. There's no shame in
it. What's more surprising is how little I valued it before now.
It took me until my secure computation post to begin appreciating it, and I think
I still don't value it enough.


# 7. Effort Doesn't Drive Quality, Experience Does

This one surprised me. Consider two posts, one about [Doctor Whooves Adventures]({% post_url 2015-09-24-how-an-audio-play-about-a-time-traveling-pony-turned-me-into-a-fanboy %}),
and the other about [AlphaGo]({% post_url 2016-01-28-deepmind-go %}).

The first was very difficult for me to write. I didn't know why I liked
*Doctor Whooves Adventures*, and even after that post I find it hard
to explain why I'm still hoping for a new episode. Over two weeks, I
agonized on how to express my love for the show, on deciding what excerpts to
share for my argument. I went back and forth, and eventually posted a final
draft to a lukewarm response. Looking back, I can understand why.

In comparison, the post on AlphaGo was written in a single night.
I wanted to strike while the iron was hot, since I knew interest in Go would be
fleeting.
Thanks to prior experience with the research areas involved, I got the gist of
the paper in a single read, and thanks to thinking about these
topics for over a year, I was able to quickly articulate my feelings on the
result.

On review, my strongest posts are almost all technical.
It's what I have the most experience writing. I've been writing
proofs since high school, gave a math talk in 11th grade, and did two research
presentations last semester. Of course my technical posts are going to be better
than my non-technical posts, *I've had years of practice for the former.*

That's not saying all my non-technical writing is bad. My best post
is still my [non-technical think piece about grad school]({% post_url 2016-01-03-grad-school %}).
What I'm saying is that if you're going to write about something unfamiliar,
don't be surprised if it takes you ages to churn out something mediocre. It took
me a month of winter break to write that graduate school post.


# 8. Try Not To Get Hung Up On Popularity

We all want other people to care about us, even when we give ourselves reasons
why they shouldn't. Writing is no exception. In fact, it's an extra dangerous area.
When you share a personal story or spend hours deciding the easiest way to explain
a concept, you can't help but grow attached to your work. And watching it
get ignored can be a punch to the gut.

It's obvious, but it bears repeating: **popular things are not always good, and
good things are not always popular.** I'm a bit obsessed with checking my blog views,
more than is healthy, and I need to remember to divorce my feelings about a
post from its view count.

What people think about your work matters. But don't let it rule everything about
you. According to Google Analytics, my three most viewed posts are:

* [A Gentle Introduction to Secure Computation]({% post_url 2016-02-11-secure-computation %})
* ["How Do You Feel About Grad School?"]({% post_url 2016-01-03-grad-school %})
* [Mystery Hunt 2016 Wrap-Up]({% post_url 2016-01-21-mysteryhunt %})

The first stuck on Hacker News for a day, and the last got shared to the Mystery Hunt subreddit.
Note that both are tangentially related to the actual quality.

If I cared only about view count, I wouldn't bother writing about
a [My Little Pony made-for-TV movie]({% post_url 2015-11-02-friendship-games-geometry %}),
because I know most people won't care. But I care, and that's why I did it.

(For the record, both my [AlphaGo post]({% post_url 2016-01-28-deepmind-go %})
and [Khan Academy post]({% post_url 2015-08-20-things-i-did-in-my-khan-academy-internship %})
deserve more views than they have. You really don't need to read that MLP post
unless you're interested in nerd-sniping commentated live.)

We'll see how I feel about these lessons in the future.
If there's one constant in the universe, it's that everyone thinks
their past self is an idiot.

As for the next few months? I plan to start flushing my queue of non-technical
post ideas. On the short list are

* A post about *Gunnerkrigg Court*
* A post on effort icebergs and criticism
* A post about obsessive fandoms
* A post detailing the hilariously incompetent history of the Dominion Online
implementation

I may also try writing some short stories. I haven't done creative
writing since high school, but after reading so much [web fiction](/recs/), I'm
up for giving it a shot.

At my current rate, four posts will take two months. With planning fallacy, maybe three.
Knowing that I still overshoot my estimates...well, let's try another six
months. Hopefully I get more than that done in six months though.

I'll close with a quote, something as "me" as I can find.

> SP: Do you see now, Doctor? This land is divided, and there is no fixing it.
>
> Doctor: Oh, I do see...I see that this **cannot stand.** I see that things are wrong here.
Things are very, very wrong, and I don't like it very much. I see that there is
pain here, and I don't like that either. I see that you've grown complacent.
I think everyone has. There is nothing worse for life than complacency,
and I shall not **have it.** I might not know many things about this land of
myth and magic, but I know that Twilight is on the other side of this conflict and
I know that this conflict is causing misery. I'm going to **correct** both those things.

Keep going. Keep trying. Because whether it works out or not, it's sadder to not try at all.

Onwards and upwards!
