title:  "Six Months of Blogging: A Retrospective"
date:   2016-02-18 00:15:00 -0800
---

Just over six months ago, I [rebooted my personal site](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/08/18/hello-world-again.html)
and started blogging. Half a year seemed like a good milestone to do a retrospective.
Besides, the part of me that loves all things meta wouldn't forgive myself if I
missed a chance for a self-referential blog post.

In the past half year of managing this blog, I've learned a lot, and I thought
it would be neat to collect all the pieces into one post.

Github Pages Was A Good Call
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My main goal with the site reboot was to give myself a platform that
let me focus almost entirely on creating content. Github Pages fit perfectly.
Free web hosting, total control over my site's content,
a transparent build process that lets me preview my site from my laptop,
and free edit history and backups thanks to Git.

I know it's incredibly nerdy to say this, but getting to write my blog posts
with Vim makes is fantastic. So far, I have image files, audio files, syntax
highlighting, Youtube embeds, spoiler buttons, and typeset math from [KaTeX](http://khan.github.io/KaTeX/).
Not only does it all work, I know exactly how it all works, because none
of the functionality has been abstracted away.

The only weird bug I've run into is a conflict between
[KaTeX and kramdown](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX/issues/20#issuecomment-133649914),
but even that wasn't terrible.
Since I had control over the site content, I could
[add a hotfix](https://github.com/alexirpan/alexirpan.github.io/commit/bb00924acd5e1e1c5fbca8fd25847058f1d9ad1c) myself.
(Please don't ask how the regex works. It just does.)



Writing Takes Even Longer Than I Imagined
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As someone who's struggled writing essays his whole life, I've never planned
to have an update schedule. If I had one, I knew I'd fall behind,
or would feel obligated to write something even when I didn't have the time
or ideas.

What I didn't expect was how much time I needed to spend on each post. Without
fail, every post I write takes longer to finish than I thought it would.
And for the record, I've known about planning fallacy from day one.
Every post, I gave myself a generous estimate, and *I still overshot it.*
As Douglas Hofstadter puts it,

> Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.

(*GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach*)
{: .centered}

Proving Hofstadter's Law wouldn't be so bad if I didn't do most of my blogging
around midnight. My nocturnal schedule makes blogging literally cut into my
hours of sleep. To show how bad this can be, let's look at the commits for
my [first technical post](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/08/23/simulating-a-biased-coin-with-a-fair-one.html).

I'll summarize the details of what the commits were for.

* Initial work saved at Thursday, 2 AM
* Completed a first draft on Friday night, working from 9 PM to midnight.
* Revising session Saturday night. Started at 11 PM, hoping to finish by 2 AM.
Ended up revising until *3:40 AM*.
* Final proofreading and launch on Sunday evening. Attempt to fix my sleep
schedule for Monday fails miserably.

Of all the reasons to stay up, this is one of the sillier ones.

In fact, I'm doing it right now. If you check the commit history for
this post, you should find a commit at 1 AM, another at 3 AM, some
2 AM commits mixed in...

It's worse for my larger posts. My [post on my feelings towards graduate school](
http://www.alexirpan.com/2016/01/03/grad-school.html) was written over a month
of winter break. Like all good programmers, I express my rage through commit logs,
and wow, there are some gems here.

> More things. All the things. man whose going to read these commits anyways (Sat Dec 19 03:36:46 2015)

> Time to in medias res this shit up (Sat Dec 26 16:50:37 2015)

> Too lazy to make good commit message (Sun Jan 3 18:28:00 2016)

> Cut a paragraph from the email. Close to something I'm okay releasing, one more reread (Sat Jan 9 01:38:18 2016)

> Okay, more changes than I thought. Going to reread again (Sat Jan 9 22:55:00 2016)

> This post keeps getting longer and longer... (Sun Jan 10 02:48:04 2016)

> URGH JUST SHIP IT. (Sun Jan 10 11:50:03 2016)

(Incidentally, this is a good argument for why you should consider
a [CFAR workshop](http://rationality.org/workshops/) if you have the money.
You can read about logical fallacies all you want, it doesn't stop you from
making them. I haven't done one because the cost is scary and my
mind is stupidly stubborn about some things, but I've been thinking about it.)


Time Is The Limiting Factor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've written fourteen posts in the past 6 months. (Fifteen, if you count this
one.) That works out to about one post every 2 weeks.

When I started this blog, I was worried I wouldn't have things to say, but
the opposite has turned true; I have so many posts I'd like to create, and
don't have the time to turn them all into reality.

I consider myself a slow person, both in problem solving and writing.
I don't care what my grades say, it's very rare for me to figure out the right
approach likes others seem to do, and most of my success comes from brute force
instead of clever insight. I have to turn an idea once in the head and thrice on
the page before I'm satisfied with it.

It baffles me that [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/)
updates at least once a week. I'm confused by [web serials](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/)
that release new chapters like clockwork. I certainly can't do that.

I think people don't respect how impressive sticking to a schedule is. Or if
they do, they don't respect it enough.


Blogging Isn't Special, But People Who Don't Think Differently
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Occasionally, people have praised my writing, or thanked me for sharing my
viewpoint, or called me special. I'm honored, and I'm very proud of some of my
posts, but from my perspective it's not that impressive. Plenty of people I know
have interesting ideas, many much better than mine, and the only difference is
that I've shared mine in a blog post instead of over beer at someone's house.

> Everybody has a secret world inside of them. All of the

> Thousands maybe.

(Neil Geiman, *The Sandman*)
{. :centered }

People think they're boring.

They think they're nothing special, that their lives are cookie cutter.
They think their perspectives are mainstream and interests are dull.

*But nothing could be further from the truth.*

Everybody's interesting. Everybody's cool. It's just hard to see, because
it's hidden behind layers of pleasantries and fear of judgment and ridicule.

We've all got our own brand of stupidity, and it's worth sharing.
It's a wonderfully naive, goofy, idealistic viewpoint, and I own the hell
out of it. I've got the rest of my life to become a cynical old man.
Why should I try to get there any faster?


I Actually Have A Writing Style
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I made a deliberate choice to keep this blog colloquial. It's my blog. It's my
voice. I don't give a shit if people look down on me for using contractions
or swearing. I'll write about things I like in the way I like to read them, and
if anyone else cares, that's just a bonus.

It's made it much easier for me to produce content, but one unintended side
effect is that I've become more aware of my speech patterns.
I start lots of sentences with "and" or "but" because I like the abruptness of starting with
a conjnction. I abuse parallel structure because it's simple, it's straightforward,
and it's an easy way to link disparate ideas together. I've adopted one sentence
paragraphs because they're very good for pounding ideas with great force.

It's pretty cool, but it also means I have to spend lots of time revising.
If I'm not careful, my sentences will all start with "I" or "It's", or they'll
all be stuctured the same way, or I'll accidentally use an uncommon word in
two adjacent sentences, or a whole host of errors that subtly weaken my prose.
Hopefully I can avoid these traps in the future.


Experience, Not Effort, Is The Biggest Factor In Quality
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This one surprised me. Consider two posts, one about [Doctor Whooves Adventures](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/09/24/how-an-audio-play-about-a-time-traveling-pony-turned-me-into-a-fanboy.html),
and the other about [AlphaGo](http://www.alexirpan.com/2016/01/28/deepmind-go.html).

The first was very difficult for me to write. I didn't know why I liked
*Doctor Whooves Adventures*, and even after writing about it I find it hard
to articulate what makes the radio play so entertaining. Over two weeks, I
agonized on how to express why the show was so good, on what to spoil and
what not to spoil. Eventually, I posted my final draft to a lukewarm response.

In comparison, the post on AlphaGo was written in a single night.
I wanted to strike while the iron was hot, since I knew it would be a fleeting topic.
Thanks to prior experience with the research areas involved, I was able to
understand the paper one a first read, and thanks to thinking about these
topics for over a year, I was able to quickly articulate my feelings about
the result. (REPHARSE, RUNS ON.)

When I look back at my past work, almost all of my favorite posts are technical
posts, because that's what I have the most experience writing. I've been writing
proofs since high school, gave a math talk in 11th grade, and did two research
presentations last semester. Of course my technical posts are going to be better
than my non-technical ones, I've literally had years of training.

Writing is the process of turning ideas into words. It's a lot easier to do that
if you've seen and explained these ideas before.

That's not saying I think all my non-technical writing is bad. My finest work is
still [my post about graduate school](http://www.alexirpan.com/2016/01/03/grad-school.html),
which was entirely a non-technical thinkpiece. (Seriously, go read it if you
haven't. I doubt I'm ever going to write anything better.)

As with all things, I can do it if I put in enough time. The only question
is whether I can allocate enough time to learn something new.


Peer Review Is Amazing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On most of my posts, I don't ask for feedback before posting them. I've been
trying to practice my revision skills, and it felt like cheating to ask for
impressions from other people.

However, on some posts I decide it's worth getting people to look at rough
drafts. I've sent drafts out for three posts: the other two envelope problem, my thoughts on
graduate school, and an introduction to secure computation.

Every time, someone pointed out something I hadn't noticed, and every post got
noticeably better after I incorporated their comments.

I think this is something about writing that everyone knows is true, but it's
hard to describe how much asking feedback actually helps. It's impossible
to recreate the first impression, and after reading so many drafts the sentences
blur together. Getting someone else to read it helps bring in more perspective.

Even the best writers send drafts to editors and friends. There's no shame in
it. What's more surprising is how little I valued peer review before now.
Somehow, that concept didn't enter my brain until now.


Popularity Is More About Exposure Than Quality
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to Google Analytics, my most viewed posts are:

* Secure Computation
* Grad School Thoughts
* Mystery Hunt 2016 Wrap-Up

Each post follows a pattern

* I submitted the post on secure computation to Hacker News. It made front page,
and stuck there for a day.
* I also submitted the post on graduate school to Hacker News. That one didn't
stick - it was both long and not quite aligned with good HN posts.
* And finally, I shared my Mystery Hunt write-up to the Mystery Hunt subreddit.

Every other post was shared only to my Facebook.

The viewership of my blog is almost entirely decided by whether I share it
ouside Facebook or not. By my rankings, my post on Go and my post about
my [Khan Academy internship](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/08/20/things-i-did-in-my-khan-academy-internship.html)
both deserve more views.

Again, I'm sure this is obvious, but popular things are not always good, and
good things are not always popular. I'm a bit stat obsessed about my blog,
probably more than is healthy, and I need to remember to divorce my feelings
about a post from its view count.


Yes, Writing More Is Helping
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of my four most recent posts, not counting this one, three are in the running
for my personal favorites. It's not a coincidence.

I've heard everybody cringes when they read their past writing, and I'm no
exception. Almost every post has something I'd change if I got another chance,
but if I started going down that road, I'd spend my whole time endlessly
tweaking sentences. About the only post I'm okay with is my post about
grad school. (Oddly enough, I'm almost okay with
[Retrospective on Friendship is Magic Season 5](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/11/29/mlp-season-5-review.html).
It must be too short to offend me.

The Next Six Months
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I plan to write more non-technical posts, to stretch those parts of my brain.
Off the top of my head, I still need to write about *Gunnerkrigg Court*,
effort icebergs, and obsessive fandoms. I may also try some short form
creative writing, there are some interesting ideas I want to explore.
(On the short list is an idea inspired by a quote from *Fine Structure*:
"There was a war in Heaven, and the debris fell to Earth.")

Ideally, I'll have more free time this semester because it's my final one,
but it's not clear that'll be true. I'll also be working full time starting
in June. So, although my goal is to write more, don't be surprised if this
doesn't happen.

MAKE AN ENDING
