title:  "Six Months of Blogging: A Retrospective"
date:   2016-02-18 00:15:00 -0800
---

Exactly six months ago, I [rebooted my personal site](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/08/18/hello-world-again.html) into the current blog. Half a year sounds like a good
interval to review how it's going so far. Every blog will inevitably talk
about itself, and now's the time.

The good news is that I've learned a bit about writing and content creation.
That wasn't something I explicitly set out to do, but in hindsight it's obvious
you learn about writing when you do more writing.

(TODO better introduction)

(TODO decide on lesson ordering)

Lesson: I Made A Good Platform Choice
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although there were some annoyances at the start, hosting on Github Pages
was definitely the right call. I don't get the usefulness of Wordpress plugins,
but I also don't have to pay for my web hosting, and can write blog posts in
a command line editor. Github Pages is a blogging platform designed for
programmers, and although it's not the most user-friendly thing, it's let
me focus almost entirely on writing instead of frontend web-development.

It's also nice that despite all the styling I get for free, I still have
complete control over the site content. When I needed math for my post about
simulating a biased coin, I could easily include KaTeX on all my pages. And when
it turned out KaTeX didn't play nicely with kramdown because of weird issues
with LaTeX comments, I could add my own hotfix. (Incidentally, I don't know how
this regex works anymore. It sure does though!)

REPHRASE THIS

I miss out on a few things, like free commenting or free analytics, but those
are hand-rollable, and it's worth it for getting to blog entirely in a git
workflow.


Lesson: Holy Shit Writing Is Time-Consuming
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Going into it, I expected to spend more time writing each post than I thought
I'd need. What I didn't expect was falling behind my estimated schedule consistently,
post after post. Knowing about the planning fallacy didn't stop me from falling
into it, and even the most generous estimates went over time.

Now, because my blog works from git commits, you don't have have to take my word
for it. I can pull up the exact timestamps. Among other things, my most productive
blogging is around midnight, but that's neither here nor there.

For my post about efficiently biasing a fair coin, I committed my first draft
at 2:05 AM. The next day, I extended it, making a commit at 9 PM and 12:12 AM.
By this point, I decided I needed to finish this post by the weekend. I already
almost had a full first draft done. It shouldn't take too long to revise it, right?
Maybe I stay up until 2 AM at most.

Well...

* Commit on Aug 22, 11:15 PM (finish adding pictures created last night)
* Commit on Aug 23, 1:39 AM (finish first draft)
* Commit on Aug 23, 2:13 AM (first revision)
* Commit on Aug 23, 2:53 AM (more editing, stil can't figure out a good conclusion.)
* Commit on Aug 23, 3:40 AM (figured out a conclusion, revised to be shorter)

Clearly, I realized I wasn't going to finish it this night, so I went to bed, and

* Commit on Aug 23, 5:52 PM (a final revision that changed more than I thought it would.)
* Commit on Aug 23, 5:59 PM (a final pass to catch spelling errors.)

Yeah. My estimate was way off. I *said* I understood that writing took a long time,
but now that I've actually done some of it, I have so much more respect for people
that update their content multiple times a week. I certainly can't do that.
Looking back, I've averaged about one post every two weeks; I don't see myself
getting any faster unless I both invest a lot more time and revise a lot less.


Lesson: Ideas are Easy, Execution is Hard
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I started this blog, I worried I'd run out of material to write about.
It turns out the opposite turned true. I have plenty of ideas, enough that I
don't have the time to try writing all of them, and I have to prune them down
to the ones I especially like.

Off the top of my head, I can name four posts I definitely plan to write about,
and one post I definitely won't because it doesn't meet my standards anymore.
Based on my past average, that'll take about two months to finish.

Sometimes, people think they're boring. They think they're nothing special, that
they don't have interesting perspectives or lives. I suppose it's good I don't
know any narcissists.

But now? I'm quite sure the opposite is true.

> Everybody has a secret world inside of them. All of the

> wonderful, stupid, amazing worlds. Not just one world. Hundreds of them.
> Thousands maybe.

Everybody's interesting. Everybody's cool. We just don't show it, because it's
so hard to expose it and we worry about being judged and ridiculed for our
own brand of stupidity. It's a wonderfully naive, goofy, idealistic viewpoint,
*and I plan to own the hell out of it.*

I've got the rest of my life to become a cynical old man. Why should I try
to get there any faster?

I still need to write about *Gunnerkrigg Court*, and obsessive fandoms, and
icebergs of effort. Maybe I'll expand on an idea inspired by a quote from
*Fine Structure*: "There was a war in Heaven, and the debris fell to Earth."
But if I'm honest, that's all far out the horizon.


Lesson: I Actually Have A Writing Style
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I made a deliberate choice to keep this blog as colloquial as possible. It's
my site, I don't give a shit if people look down on me for using contractions
or swearing.

At the same time, I've noticed my writing becomes very reptitive if I'm not careful
about it. I love, love using parallelism. I'm fond of starting sentences with
"And" or "But", because I like how the period before the connective (CHECK?)
stops and starts the reading flow.

I adopted short paragraphs because they're an easy way to highlight specific
ideas.

I start lots of sentences with I, pretending like it's for repetition, but
it's really because it's easier than figuring out more unique sentence
constructions.

I don't if this is my style or if it's just my writing habits. Maybe the two
are the same thing.
