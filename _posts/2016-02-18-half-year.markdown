title:  "Six Months of Blogging: A Retrospective"
date:   2016-02-18 00:15:00 -0800
---

Exactly six months ago, I [rebooted my personal site](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/08/18/hello-world-again.html) into the current blog. Half a year sounds like a good
interval to review how it's going so far. Every blog will inevitably talk
about itself, and now's the time. (It also gives me an excuse to link back
to all my previous posts to try to increase engagement.)

The good news is that I've learned a bit about writing and content creation.
That wasn't something I explicitly set out to do, but in hindsight it's obvious
you learn about writing when you do more writing.

(TODO better introduction)

(TODO decide on lesson ordering)

Lesson: I Made A Good Platform Choice
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although there were some annoyances at the start, hosting on Github Pages
was definitely the right call. I don't get the usefulness of Wordpress plugins,
but I also don't have to pay for my web hosting, and can write blog posts in
a command line editor. Github Pages is a blogging platform designed for
programmers, and although it's not the most user-friendly thing, it's let
me focus almost entirely on writing instead of frontend web-development.

It's also nice that despite all the styling I get for free, I still have
complete control over the site content. When I needed math for my post about
simulating a biased coin, I could easily include KaTeX on all my pages. And when
it turned out KaTeX didn't play nicely with kramdown because of weird issues
with LaTeX comments, I could add my own hotfix. (Incidentally, I don't know how
this regex works anymore. It sure does though!)

REPHRASE THIS

I miss out on a few things, like free commenting or free analytics, but those
are hand-rollable, and it's worth it for getting to blog entirely in a git
workflow.


Lesson: Holy Shit Writing Is Time-Consuming
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.

(Douglas Hofstadter, *GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach*)
{: .centered}

Going into it, I expected to spend more time writing each post than I thought
I'd need. What I didn't expect was falling behind my estimated schedule consistently,
post after post. Knowing about the planning fallacy didn't stop me from falling
into it, and even the most generous estimates went over time.

Now, because my blog works from git commits, you don't have have to take my word
for it. I can pull up the exact timestamps. Among other things, my most productive
blogging is around midnight, but that's neither here nor there.

For my post about efficiently biasing a fair coin, I committed my first draft
at 2:05 AM. The next day, I extended it, making a commit at 9 PM and 12:12 AM.
By this point, I decided I needed to finish this post by the weekend. I already
almost had a full first draft done. It shouldn't take too long to revise it, right?
Maybe I stay up until 2 AM at most.

Well...

* Commit on Aug 22, 11:15 PM (finish adding pictures created last night)
* Commit on Aug 23, 1:39 AM (finish first draft)
* Commit on Aug 23, 2:13 AM (first revision)
* Commit on Aug 23, 2:53 AM (more editing, stil can't figure out a good conclusion.)
* Commit on Aug 23, 3:40 AM (figured out a conclusion, revised to be shorter)

Clearly, I realized I wasn't going to finish it this night, so I went to bed, and

* Commit on Aug 23, 5:52 PM (a final revision that changed more than I thought it would.)
* Commit on Aug 23, 5:59 PM (a final pass to catch spelling errors.)

Yeah. My estimate was way off. I *said* I understood that writing took a long time,
but now that I've actually done some of it, I have so much more respect for people
that update their content multiple times a week. I certainly can't do that.
Looking back, I've averaged about one post every two weeks; I don't see myself
getting any faster unless I both invest a lot more time and revise a lot less.


Lesson: Ideas are Easy, Execution is Hard
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I started this blog, I worried I'd run out of material to write about.
It turns out the opposite turned true. I have plenty of ideas, enough that I
don't have the time to try writing all of them, and I have to prune them down
to the ones I especially like.

Off the top of my head, I can name four posts I definitely plan to write about,
and one post I definitely won't because it doesn't meet my standards anymore.
Based on my past average, that'll take about two months to finish.

Sometimes, people think they're boring. They think they're nothing special, that
they don't have interesting perspectives or lives. I suppose it's good I don't
know any narcissists.

But now? I'm quite sure the opposite is true.

> Everybody has a secret world inside of them. All of the
> people in the whole world, I mean everybody. No matter how dull and boring they
> are on the outside, inside them they've all got unimaginable, magnificent,
> wonderful, stupid, amazing worlds. Not just one world. Hundreds of them.
> Thousands maybe.

(Neil Geiman, *The Sandman*)
{. :centered }

Everybody's interesting. Everybody's cool. We just don't show it, because it's
so hard to expose it and we worry about being judged and ridiculed for our
own brand of stupidity. It's a wonderfully naive, goofy, idealistic viewpoint,
*and I plan to own the hell out of it.*

I've got the rest of my life to become a cynical old man. Why should I try
to get there any faster?

I still need to write about *Gunnerkrigg Court*, and obsessive fandoms, and
icebergs of effort. Maybe I'll expand on an idea inspired by a quote from
*Fine Structure*: "There was a war in Heaven, and the debris fell to Earth."
But if I'm honest, that's all far out the horizon.


Lesson: I Actually Have A Writing Style
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I made a deliberate choice to keep this blog as colloquial as possible. It's
my site, I don't give a shit if people look down on me for using contractions
or swearing.

At the same time, I've noticed my writing becomes very reptitive if I'm not careful
about it. I love, love using parallelism. I'm fond of starting sentences with
"And" or "But", because I like how the period before the connective (CHECK?)
stops and starts the reading flow.

I adopted short paragraphs because they're an easy way to highlight specific
ideas.

I start lots of sentences with I, pretending like it's for repetition, but
it's really because it's easier than figuring out more unique sentence
constructions.

I don't if this is my style or if it's just my writing habits. Maybe the two
are the same thing.


Lesson: Effort Has Weak Correlation With Writing Quality
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The correlation between effort and quality seems obvious, but what surprised
me is how weak it is.

For examples, consider two posts, one about Doctor Whooves Adventures and one
about AlphaGo. The Doctor Whooves Adventures post was in the works for almost
a month, and I spent a long time writing it because I didn't quite know what
I wanted to say. (CHECK THE TIME). In contrast, I wrote the AlphaGo post in a day,
because I wanted to hit the anvil while it was hot. In retrospect, the AlphaGo
post was much, much better. Even accounting for having more experience, I have
trouble believing that a few blog posts of practice let me produce better
content in a day than I could in a month.

The real lesson here is that if writing is the process that turns ideas into
words, then writing is a lot easier if you already have a feeling on what
you want to say.

Of course, you still need to edit, and you still need to revise, but sometimes
you find a good phrasing right away.


Lesson: More Eyes Is Strongly Correlated With Writing Quality
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've asked for feedback on three posts: biasing a fair coin, my thoughts on
graduate school, and an introduction to secure computation. Every single
post got astoundingly better once I got other people's feedback.

Everyone can read something only once. Trying to recapture reading with a set
of fresh eyes is hopeless, and eventually the brain glazes over the minor details,
like sentence structures or old ideas. It's been extraordinarily helpful to
get feedback on the tone or clarity of the post.

I've been trying to get better at editing by myself, but even the best writers
have other people read their drafts. There's no shame in it.

(EXPAND? PHIL FISH QUOTE?)


Lesson: Quality Correlates Weakly With Popularity
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to Google Analytics, my most popular posts are

* Secure Computation
* Grad School Thoughts
* Mystery Hunt 2016 Wrap-Up

Secure computation wins by a mile because I submitted it to HN, and it was
on the front page for a day. Grad School Thoughts got very good traction
among my Facebook friends and I tried submitting it to HN. Mystery Hunt 2016 Wrap-Up
was submitted to the Mystery Hunt subreddit.

Right now, the viewership of my blog is almost entirely decided by whether I
share it outside Facebook, and whether it gets traction outside Facebook.

By my standards of quality, my best posts are Grad School Thoughs, AlphaGo,
and A Gentle Introduction to SEcure Computation. They also happen to be three
of my four most recent posts (not counting this one.)
