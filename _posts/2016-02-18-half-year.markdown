title:  "Six Months of Blogging: A Retrospective"
date:   2016-02-18 00:15:00 -0800
---

A few days ago, I noticed I was coming up on six months since my
[personal site reboot](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/08/18/hello-world-again.html).
Half a year seemed like a good milestone to look back on.
Every blog inevitably talks about itself, and now's the time.
(I'll admit it also gives me a good reason to link lots of old posts.)

When I started blogging, I had three goals.

* Introduce people to interesting technical concepts, with focus on concepts that
don't rely on too much prior knowledge.
* Make it easy for me to practice writing by giving myself a platform to share
ideas to a wider audience, then actually write posts.
* Write about somethign itneresting?

So far, I'd say I'm making good progress on the first, okay on the second, and
not very much on the third. I expected my blog to be much more cohesive than
it became. My guess was 50% technical posts and 50% posts about stories I liked,
but it ended up becoming more like an extension of my thoughts, which are
off-the-wall almost by choice.

(TODO better introduction.)


Github Pages Was A Good Call
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although there was upfront cost, hosting on Github Pages was definitely a good
call. Free web hosting that auto-scales if I need it to is a huge plus, and I
don't have any interactive content anyways. (Not that I need the auto-scaling...)

It's a bit annoying that I had to add analytics and comments by myself,
but the gains outweigh the losses by far. This is a very programmer thing to
say, but writing my blog posts in vim has been wonderful. (For the record,
I'm not text editor-ist. Emacs and Sublime are welcome to hang out.)
Like I said in my first post: WYSIWYG editors be damned, all I need is a
terminal.

It's also nice that if I choose to, I could tweak the styling of my site
as much as I wanted. Complete transparent control over my site's content is
a beautiful thing. When I needed to add math, I could easily choose to use
KaTeX instead of MathJax. And when it turned out KaTeX and kramdown didn't
mix well, I could write the Javascript hotfix myself.
(Don't ask how the regex works, it just does.)



Holy Shit, Writing Takes Time
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As someone who's struggled with essays his whole life, I knew writing was hard.
What I didn't expect was to always, always take longer than I thought to
write something. Note that this is with knowing about planning fallacy from
day one. *I gave myself leeway, and still overshot it every time.*

(EXPLAIN THE LINK)
My most productive blogging hours start near midnight, and I've definitely
lost sleep while revising drafts. In fact, I'm doing it right now! Check
the commit history for this post, you'll find a commit at 1 AM Pacific time. I need
to wake up early too...

In fact, let's look at my first technical post, about how to [efficiently turn a
fair coin into a biased one](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/08/23/simulating-a-biased-coin-with-a-fair-one.html).
Thanks to Git, I have timestamps of every single commit.

![Commits for coins branch](/public/half-year/coins-commits.png)
{: .centered}

First commit at 2 AM, worked on it the next day from 9 PM til midnight, started
a final pass Saturday midnight and stayed up until 3:40 AM, then finally released
it Sunday evening.

It's worse for my larger posts. My first draft about research and graduate school
was from October. I put it off until November, joking that it would take me
until December to finish it. The post actually came out mid-January, and this
is with the freedom I had from winter break.

(Incidentally, this is the biggest argument for why you should consider
a [CFAR workshop](http://rationality.org/workshops/) if you have the money.
Knowledge of logical fallacies doesn't
stop you from making them. I haven't done one because the cost is scary and my
mind has lots of inertia, but it's slowly getting more appealing.)

I did some quick calculation, and turned up 14 posts in the past 6 months. (15
if you count this one.) That works out to about one post every two weeks.

I literally cannot see myself updating any faster than once a week. It's
not possible for me unless I get a lot better at writing. I consider myself
a slow person, both in problem solving and writing. I can't solve problems unless
I think about them for a long time. I rarely ask questions in lecture, because
I don't even follow enough to ask a question in the first place. And when
it comes to writing, I have to turn an idea once in the head and thrice on
the page before I feel it's explained well.

It baffles me that people can update their blogs several times a week while holding
full time jobs. I certainly can't do that.
Right now, I estimate I could go up to one post a week, and that's
if I devoted a lot more and revised a lot less.





Ideas are Easy, Execution is Hard
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I started this blog, I was worried I'd run out of topics to write about.
It turns out the opposite is true; the limiting factor is time.

I have plenty of ideas, enough that I
don't have the time to write posts for all of them. Each post is a 2-4 week
commitment, and I have to prune ideas down to ones I can see myself
working on for that long. My standard for topics worth writing about rose so
much the past 6 months. (REORDER)

Off the top of my head, I have four posts I want to write, and have no work
on any of them.

Occasionally, people have thanked me for my writing, or called me interesting
or special. I'm honored, and I'm very proud of some of my posts, but I don't
think I'm owed that praise. From my perspective, I've seen some ideas,
I've thought about parts of my life, and I decided it was worth sharing. Other
people go through the same things. The only difference is whether they share
it or not.

(Neil Geiman, *The Sandman*)
{. :centered }

People think they're boring, that they're nothing special, that their lives
are cookie cutter and their perspectives are mainstream, but I'm confident
that's all wrong. Everybody's interesting.
Everybody's cool. We just don't show it, because it's
so hard to expose it and we worry about being judged and ridiculed for our
own brand of stupidity. It's a wonderfully naive, goofy, idealistic viewpoint,
and I own the hell out of it.
I've got the rest of my life to become a cynical old man. Why should I try
to get there any faster?


I Actually Have A Writing Style
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I made a deliberate choice to keep this blog colloquial. It's my blog and my
voice. I don't give a shit if people look down on me for using contractions
or swearing. I write about things I like in the way I like to read them, and
if anyone else cares, that's just a bonus.

One unintended result is that I've become more aware of my speech patterns,
because they show up in my writing patterns. I start lots of sentences
with "and" or "but" because I like the abruptness of starting with
a conjnction. I abuse parallel structure because it's simple, it's straightforward,
and it's an easy way to link disparate ideas together.

I've adopted short paragraphs because they're very good at highlighting
specific ideas I want to get across.

However, that's not necessarily a good thing. One thing I've struggled with
is making sure my sentence lengths and word choices are varied. If I'm not
careful, every sentence will meander, and words will pop up again and again
because I'm more used to using them. It's just how my thought process works.

I'm not sure if this counts as a writing style. It may just be my writing
habits. Or, maybe there isn't a great distinction between the two.


Experience, Not Effort, Is The Biggest Factor In Quality
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This one surprised me. My writing quality depends almost entirely on how well
I understand the ideas behind it.

Consider two posts, one about [Doctor Whooves Adventures](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/09/24/how-an-audio-play-about-a-time-traveling-pony-turned-me-into-a-fanboy.html),
and the other about [AlphaGo](http://www.alexirpan.com/2016/01/28/deepmind-go.html).

The first was very difficult for me to write. I didn't know why I liked
*Doctor Whooves Adventures*, and even after writing about it I find it hard
to articulate what makes the radio play so entertaining. Over two weeks, I
agonized on how to express why the show was so good, on what to spoil and
what not to spoil. Eventually, I posted my final draft to a lukewarm response.
On re-read, it's a weak post.

On the other hand, the post on AlphaGo was written in a single night.
I wanted to hit the hammer (CHECK) while it was hot. I've been writing proofs
since 9th grade, gave a math talk in 11th grade, and had just finished
TAing a discrete math course, so I had lots of experience explaining technical
material to unfamiliar audiences. I wrote a first draft, spent an hour revising
it, and released it next morning. It was one of my most popular posts, and
although it could be cleaned up, the core ideas are all there.

Writing is the process that turns ideas into words. It turns out it's a lot
easier if you already know how you want to express those ideas are. It's not
a coincidence that many of my better posts are technical explanations instead
of thinkpieces.

(REPHRASE)

Hopefully I'll get better at non-technical writing in the upcoming months.

(ADD TO THINGS HERE)


The Second Biggest Factor Is Peer Review
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've sent drafts for feedback on three posts: biasing a fair coin, my thoughts on
graduate school, and an introduction to secure computation. Every one got
astoundingly better.

I think this is something about writing that everyone knows is true, but it's
hard to describe how much it actually helps. The first impression is both
important and impossible to recreate. Eventually, the brain glazes over the
minor details, and gets set into its own interpretation of the sentences.

> I don't know what I think of it anymore, I've been staring at it for so long.
> I can't tell. I really can't tell if it's good or not. [... I] don't even
> see the mistakes anymore.

(Phil Fish, *Indie Game: The Movie*)
{: .centered }

Even the best writers send drafts to editors and friends. There's no shame in
it. In fact, it's more surprising that I didn't value peer review so
highly before now. Somehow, that concept didn't enter my brain until now.


Quality Doesn't Automatically Lead To Popularity
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to Google Analytics, my most popular posts are

* Secure Computation
* Grad School Thoughts
* Mystery Hunt 2016 Wrap-Up

However, the popularity is only loosely connected to the content

* I submitted the post on secure computation to Hacker News, and it was on
the front page for a day.
* I also submitted my graduate school post to Hacker News. That one didn't
stick, but it got very good traction among Facebook friends (who were almost
all in college and could relate to many of my thoughts.)
* And finally, I shared the Mystery Hunt post on the Mystery Hunt subreddit.

Right now, the viewership of my blog is almost entirely decided by whether I
share it outside Facebook or not. Alright, so what if I ignore that? All of
my blog posts are shared on my personal Facebook. By activity there,
my most popular posts are

* Grad School Thoughts
* Things I Did In My Khan Academy Internship
* Tie between Go: More Complicated Than Go Fish and Simulating a Biased Coin With A Fair One

And although this is closer to my standard of quality, I'd rank my Secure
Computation Post as better than my Khan Academy post.

Again, it's an obvious point, but popularity is driven by several factors
besides quality. I'm a bit stat obsessed about my blog, probably more than is
healthy, and I need to remember to judge posts by myself instead of by
view count.


Yes, Writing More Is Helping
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's not a coincidence that of my four most recent posts, three are in the running
for the best quality. I've heard everybody cringes when they read their past
writing, and I'm no exception; on almost every post I notice things I want to change.
About the only post I'm okay with is my post about grad school, and that's
because I've already looked at it for so long.

(oddly enough, Retrospective on Friendship is Magic Season 5 got close. It
must be too short for it to offend me too much.)


The Next Six Months
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I plan to write more non-technical posts, to stretch those parts of my brain.
Off the top of my head, I still need to write about *Gunnerkrigg Court*,
effort icebergs, and obsessive fandoms. I may also try some short form
creative writing, there are some interesting ideas I want to explore.
(On the short list is an idea inspired by a quote from *Fine Structure*:
"There was a war in Heaven, and the debris fell to Earth.")

Ideally, I'll have more free time this semester because it's my final one,
but it's not clear that'll be true. I'll also be working full time starting
in June. So, although my goal is to write more, don't be surprised if this
doesn't happen.

MAKE AN ENDING
