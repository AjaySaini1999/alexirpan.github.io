Somebody showed me a formula for $$\pi$$ based on prime numbers that
was pretty cool. That got me thinking about other cool
results that relate number theory and $$\pi$$ in unexpected ways.
I figured they would make a nice short update.

As a disclaimer, I am not a math major, and my math education
stopped at the start of real analysis. I'm targeting this towards
the high school math contest audience, meaning I won't assume anything above
calculus, but I also assume readers are interested in mathematics and
will look up unfamiliar terms on their own.


Relatively Prime Random Numbers
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Let $$a$$ and $$b$$ be two uniformly random natural numbers.
What is the probability $$a$$ and $$b$$ are relatively prime?

First off, this problem isn't that well formed. There are infinitely
many natural numbers, and it's unclear how we'd pick one of infinitely
many things. To be more formal, we should really state the problem
this way.

> Let $$P(n)$$ be the probability that two uniformly random
> natural numberes from $$1$$ to $$n$$ (inclusive) are relatively prime.
> What is $$\lim_{n\to\infty} P(n)$$?

(From now on I'll use $$P(\infty)$$ for the limit.)

Alright, we have a problem. Now what? First, let's get an expression
at all. We're good if $$a$$ and $$b$$ share no common factors. For this
to be true, for every prime $$p$$ at most one of $$a,b$$ can be divisible
by $$p$$. Equivalently, $$a$$ and $$b$$ are not both divisible by $$p$$.

Since we pick naturals uniformly at random, the probability a random
natural is divisible by $$p$$ is $$1/p$$. The probabillity both
numbers are divisible by $$p$$ must be $$1/p^2$$, giving the following.

$$
    P(\infty) = \left(1 - \frac{1}{2^2}\right)
                \left(1 - \frac{1}{3^2}\right)
                \left(1 - \frac{1}{5^2}\right)\cdots
              = \prod_{p\text{ prime}} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p^2}\right)
$$

Now, here's where you apply an interesting trick - take the reciprocal
of both sides.

$$
    \frac{1}{P(\infty)}
    = \frac{1}{\left(1 - \frac{1}{2^2}\right)}
      \frac{1}{\left(1 - \frac{1}{3^2}\right)}
      \frac{1}{\left(1 - \frac{1}{5^2}\right)}\cdots
$$
