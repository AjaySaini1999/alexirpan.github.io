For Mystery Hunt 2020, I hunted with teammate, the same team I hunted with
last year. We ended up smashing all my expectations. By puzzle count, we were
2nd. By metas, we were 2nd to solve all metas. By finishing the Hunt, we
were 3rd, due to getting stuck on the last puzzle (more on that later).
This was the first year where teammate got a call from HQ warning us that
we were in contention for winning, and although I knew teammate was competitive,
last year we were far behind the lead teams. This year, we weren't.

Based on questions Left Out asked us during Hunt interactions, I don't think many
Mystery Hunt veterans know where teammate came from. Very briefly, teammate
is a mix of people from Puzzlehunt CMU, some Bay Area puzzlers from Berkeley,
some people from Super Team Awesome, and friend branching out from there.
Almost all the original members of teammate used to hunt with Galactic (FULL NAME),
but one year they decided to start their own team, and teammate and Galactic
have been sister teams ever since. The two teams have similar team culture
and age demographics. For the former, meme-heavy and heavy willingness to backsolve.
For the latter, the majority of both teams is under 30. I'm actually not sure
if anyone on teammate is over 30, now that I think about it.

This showed itself
most strongly when we did the Balloon Vendor interaction. Left Out started a
clue with "BTS..." and we immediately guess K-pop, then they gave us questions
about stovepop popcorn and Pop-Up Video that stumped everyone.

Before Hunt, members of both team's leadership were seriously considering
merging Galactic and teammate. The downside would be a less fun Hunt. The upside
would be significantly better odds of winning. The vote ended at deciding not
to merge, and based on the solve graphs, we clearly didn't need to merge to be
a contender for the coin this year. However, we weren't surprised to see Galactic
win, since we knew they wanted to be more competitive this year. (Well, okay,
I was a bit surprised, since I predict Palindrome to win every year, and every
year it's just a bit wrong.)

I felt this year's Hunt was really good, in inventiveness of its structure
and polish in its puzzle. However, for me it still feels a bit sour due to how the
Hunt ended for us.

On Friday night, we felt we were doing well. I ended up staying up until 6 AM and
getting 4 hours fo sleep before heading back. On Saturday night, we *knew* we
were doing well. We rightly guessed we had unlocked every round, we were making
good progress on all the metas, and it started to look like if I went to bed,
I would wake up after we finished Hunt. So I pulled an all-nighter, and I know other
people who pulled one as well.

Every time we solved a meta, we got back a pressed penny. They definitely looked like
puzzle info, but I expected that we'd get a shell metameta, and didn't bother
looking too closely. Additionally, our homebase was a fairly long walk from
Hunt HQ, and Left Out told us it would be fine if we picked them in batches,
to avoid having to send someone there and back for each meta solve.
We got the final penny, didn't unlock a shell, and realized it was a pure metapuzzle,
at which point we got horribly stuck on the a-ha. The Workshop isn't up on
the hunt website yet, but basically, every pressed penny had 3 arrows and 3 images
on it, stuck onto a piece of paper describing the land it was from. The
pennies could be arranged into a unique layout where all the images were
oriented correctly and every arrow on every penny pointed to another one. At that
point, we had no idea what to do. You can check wrap-up for the final step, but
we were pretty despondent after 4 hours with no progress.

The thing keeping us going was knowing that if we were 1st, there was no way we
had a 4 hour lead over 2nd place, and we hadn't gotten a "coin is found" email.
That mean that any other teams in contention had to be stuck on the same puzzle
as us. Which was great for motivation, but bad for anybody looking to sleep,
because any moment could be the moment we got the a-ha and went to the runaround.

When the 3 PM coin email came, our entire team had been looking at Workshop
for 6 hours, knew it was the only puzzle that mattered for Hunt
completion, and we were still stuck. Feels bad. As soon as the coin was found,
Left Out called us, gave us some hints, and fastforwarded us through the
endgame, which was both very fun and quite impressive.

So, what happened? Word on the grapevine was that Workshop testsolved
perfectly fine within Left Out, and they were surprised it took teams as long
as it did to finish the Hunt. In my opinion, part of what played into this
was that we knew the pennies would be part of a puzzle, but we assumed we
could look at it later, when we had complete information.
By the time we actually looked at the pennies, the team was very
sleep-deprived and unable to figure
