Internal response: *Oh god, I have no idea.
Oh jeez, oh jeez, can I defer this decision? Yes? Okay, let's do that.*

External response: "Well, I have mixed feelings about it."

vignettes:
- First day in the lab (at start of the semester)
- First day in the lab (for real)
    - Includes first talk
- Weekly catchup with a small group, after having done no work.

It's the start of Spring 2014. I'm a sophomore and I'm taking my first two CS
upper divisions, Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence. I'm about to
get interviewed by the AI professor on whether I'd be qualifed to do research
with him.

The professor's office is in the research lab, and the lab is behind a card key
lock. After waiting 10 minutes, someone lets me in, and we start talking.

"So, what are you interested in researching?"

I don't have a good answer to that question. I vaguely like algorithms, and
have dabbled in AI by coding up game tree search for a few games, but I don't
know what to say besides that. All I know is that I want to try doing
research, because I haven't done any yet. I mumble out an incoherent reply,
and after talking more it's clear I'm not qualified. He wishes me luck in
the class, and I leave.

With no research, no relationships, almost no extracurriculars, and a barely
functioning social life, I have the freedom to put all the time I want
into schoolwork.

I get the top score on the AI final, placing sixth in the class.

The next semester, I start doing research.

\*\*\*

Just this once, let's set aside all self-deprecation and doublethink about
myself.

Objectively, I am doing very well in the Berkeley CS program.

And as someone who has more A's than B's on their transcript, everyone
eventually asks me what my future plans are. Or to be more precise, everyone
assumes my future plans are graduate school. Isn't it obvious?
Look at this man: high GPA, doing research, taking graduate classes in
junior year because he's run out of upper division courses that interest him.
That's not the face of someone who plans to work in industry, shuffling bits
day in and they out. They're an academic, through and thorugh.

Well...

(I like this so far, but I need a good connector.)

On one hand, the software industry pays stupidly well. Money is pretty far down
on my priority list, but it's not ignorable. Internships at big name
companies will pay $6000 or $7000 a month, well over the national average.
On average, new grads at Berkeley get offers of over $100000 base annual salary.
(LOOK UP THE STATS.) Frankly, these numbers are ridiculous. It's unclear whether
these salaries are a bubble or if software actually creates that much economic
value, but right now that's the state of things.

A job in industry will have immediate impact on the world. Research can have
incredibly far reaching impact, but it takes five to ten years for research to
trickle down into industry, and until then very few people know what you're talking about.

Big name companies sell themselves by offering insane perks. Have free lunch,
have free dinner, we have a ball pit on campus, we have massagers on campus.
You'll never go hungry with all the food we have here. And by the way, we have
some interesting problems to solve. You like problem solving, right?

Startups sell you with the dream of changing the world. We're changing how
people connect with each other. We're changing transportation. You, yes you,
can make a difference, and if we make it big you'll make it out like a king.

Then, we come to graduate school. A PhD program sells itself with research.
You will tackle the hardest problems, the ones where no one knows the answer.
It could take you years to learn your subject of interest. It will be hard,
and difficult, but in the end you will learn what it feels like to truly
know something.

If you're looking for money, grad school isn't for you.

If you want to coast through life with a reasonable
living salary, grad school isn't for you.

The only, only plausible reason to go
to computer science grad school is because you want to do research.

For many people, that's an immediate deal breaker. For me, it isn't.
Money isn't my top priority, and I wouldn't feel good about myself if I
wasn't pushing myself to be better, to be the person I wish I could be instead
of the person I actually am.
Grad school should be a good fit, right?

First day in the lab. I'm meeting with a grad student to figure out what topics
I can do research in. He asks me how much I know about neural nets. Huh.
What are those?

He explains that you take some input state, apply a linear function to it,
apply a nonlinearity to that output, repeat it a few times, and get something
that works on a wide range of problems. I don't understand why this should work,
and he admits that a lot of things about neural nets aren't well understood.
After the brief introduction, he mentions a few topics that are interesting,
and I latch onto the problem of learning how to efficiently search an exponentially
large state space to find good outcomes.

First week in the lab. I've got an account on one of desktops in the lab. The
lab's pretty big, around 30-40 computers total. I'm not sure where to start, but
I know that when people do research, they write papers. I start reading releveant
papers and work through the tutorials on Theano for building neural nets.

Meanwhile, I overhear the most incomprehensible things.

"Hey, do you understand recurrent neural nets?"

"Kind of? I implemented one a while back."

"Okay, that's better than me. Mind helping me understand LSTMs?"

The words wash over me, and I try not to let it discourage me. I've just
started, there's no way I should know what they're talking about. Okay, now
how does this sample code work?

Two hours later, I don't feel any closer to getting things, and I have to go to
class. Okay, that's also fine. I'll try more later.

The same song and dance continues for the next two weeks. I go to the weekly
group meeting, and get lost on literally the first slide. I start reading
the literature, and get daunted at all the impressive results I see. During my
one-on-one meeting, I mention that it feels like the problem I was working on
was already solved, and the graduate student has to gently remind me that
things aren't true just because someone writes a paper about it. All that means
is that the method works on exactly the problems mentioned in the paper, and
probably fails on a few problems that the authors didn't include.
After hearing that, and after reading The Control Group Is OUt Of Control (LINK),
I start treating papers as guidelines instead of cold hard truth, but that
doesn't help me stop drowning as I realize how deep everything goes.

By the time I realize I can (and should) be implementing an algorithm straight
out of the AI course I took, it's been three weeks.

By the time I understand and implement my first neural net in Theano, it's
been a month and a half.

Research is hard.

No one, not even the most brilliantly arrogant people I know, has ever said
anything otherwise. Getting no progress for a few weeks is expected. Getting
marginal progress after a few months is entirely believable. These are things
that everyone who does research says, but it doesn't prepare you for the reality.
As an undergrad, I found this even worse, because I was so used to courses.
STEAL FROM FB POST HERE.
The shift from classes to research is jarring, and even when I knew it was coming
it still hit like a freight train.

Every top CS graduate school program will ask for your prior research experience.
The obvious reason they ask for this is because they want to know who will be
a good PhD student, but there's an implicit reason to this too. Once you remove
the structure of a class, of homework sets, of midterms and finals and grades,
a grad student needs to have the motivation to keep learning new things. Study
material almost exclusively for the sake of learning something interesting, when
no one will notice of care if you don't.

I'm getting better at this, but it's still just as tricky as when I first started.

REPHRASE THIS SECTION

\*\*\*
{: .centered }

It's two months since I started. I had some ideas, did a literature check, and
found out somebody implemented them eight years ago. I'm filled with confidence.
Another researcher had the same idea, and it led to a publication! My idea is valid!
Maybe I'm not a fraud after all. It reinforces one of the vague principles
in my brain: I'm not special, I'm just a person. Taking wisdom from tips about
startups, the marketplace for ideas is competitive. Either an idea is old hat,
or many people are discovering it simultaneously.

NOT ACTUALLY ACCURATE HERE. (I dropped 104 around week 4 IIRC)

The next few weeks pass uneventfully. Then it all goes wrong. Horribly long
problem sets overlap each other. I'm trying to learn about thread schedulers
and clopen sets and infinite-dimensional vector spaces and Jacobians and
it's a mess. A complete mess. By the time I finish everything to my satisfaction,
I have no time for research that week. I sheepishly try to cobble something
together in time for my one-on-one, but
there's not much I can do with no code and no ideas.

In my meeting, I hear disappointment in his words, and I can't
tell if he's actually disappointed or if I'm adding my self-loathing into
his speech because that's what I want to hear.

That afternoon, I lie on my bed and stare at the ceiling, thoughts swirling
in my head.

*You're pushing yourself too hard. You need to slow down.*

*Or maybe*, says another voice, *maybe you weren't pushing yourself enough
before, and now you are. Do you believe in growth through adversity or not?*

*I do. I really do. It doesn't mean I'm not pushing myself too hard.*

The blessing and curse of the Information Age is that if you want to
learn something, you can. Ever wondered what gerrymandering was? Here, go
to Wikipedia. What about World War II? Well, that's covered too, in volumes and
volumes of books, and also in a few comics, and also in an anime.

One day, I find out Orson Scott Card's political views clash with your own.
The work is divided from the author, but it slightly colors how you perceive
any novels he writes. The next, I read that if the US had invaded Cuba during the Cuban
Missile Crisis, Fidel Castro would have ordered a nuclear attack, knowing it
would be the end of the world.

One day I binge read PhD Comics and The PhD Grind.

When it comes to graduate school, you don't have to look very hard to find the
black humor. You also don't have to look very hard to find stories that are
dark with no laughs.

When it comes to grad school, it's no different. You don't even have to look
very deep; read just a bit of PhD comics and you'll pick up the black humor
pretty quick. Here you are, working on your PhD, doing research in something that
you can only explain to around a few hundred and only really explain to a few tens.
Meanwhile, the outside world keeps on spinning, as everyone with "real" jobs
seems to actually be happy and unstressed...

Or, maybe you read the PhD grind, a frank account of the author's experience
going through the PhD program at Stanford. If you are at all interested in going
for a PhD, I consider it required reading material. There are a lot of comments
that resonated with me, most especially this one.

> I discovered over the past 5 years that I love being a spectator of
> research, but the burden of being a continual producer of new research is
> just too great for me.

That's the problem. That's the root cause of all my indecision. People take
a lot of technology for granted, but when I step back and take a look, **really**
take a look, it is completely baffling that we can do the things we can today.
Speech recognition went from garbage to in every smartphone. Image classification
went from a pipe dream to a reality that companies are fighting tooth and nail
over. The rate of progress is unbelieveable, and it seems like every 2-3 months
there's a new breakthrough that pushes the scope of human knowledge every
so slightly outward.

Then I sit down and try to do research, and make only incremental progress after
several months of work.

The machine of research is a beautiful piece of work, and it can be gratifying to
know you are literally building the future, but in the end you're still just
one cog in a mass of gears and wires.

\*\*\*

There's a common refrain among professors to prospective graduate students:
"If you could be happy doing anything else, don't go into academia."

FLESH THIS OUT AND REORGANIZE IT LATER

\*\*\*

Grad school demands you to be excellent.

Here's how it goes: some number of people get into graduate school programs
at top universities. The vast majority have GPAs very close to 4.0, have prior
research experience, and have an idea of what they want to do research in.
At least a quarter of them will drop out, possibly with an MS.
(That's the CMU drop out rate as of 2014.)

When going into top universities like Berkeley for undergrad, people talk about
how they were the top of their class in high school, and now they have to
get used to being average. The same logic applies to graduate school, but
now the standard for "average" is a 3.5 GPA from a top university. Then, you need
to somehow standout among that crowd when looking for faculty positions to snag
a tenure-track position instead of an adjunct, then need to stand out for tenure...
Once you get up that high, almost everyone has inferiority complexes (???) and
stays humble, and now they're asked to prove they're the shiniest diamond in all
the land. It's a staggeringly tall order, and the prospects if you aren't
near the top seem especially bad. Around a quarter of adjunct faculty are on
food stamps, and that's assuming you can even find one at all. Alternatively,
you can apply for a CS research lab, but I've heard those are as competitive
as getting faculty positions.
