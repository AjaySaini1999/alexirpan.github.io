title:  "\"How Do You Feel About Grad School?\""

Outline:
    The goal is to tie the personal stories into the greater reasoning of how I
    feel about grad school. It makes most sense to do stories chronologically,
    and that should guide the general passages.
    - Beginning, where I don't know what research is like
    - Starting research for first time. Imposter feelings, trying to keep up.
    - Middle section. Don't have the time, too busy, too much work.
    - Get some interesting data.
    - End: go to a group meeting, actually understand most of it. Book ends
    the first group meeting I go to?
    - Or, I can book end with my final talk with the professor.

    General passages:
    - Imposter syndrome.
    - The work/feeling of always having more to do.
    - Potential impact between industry and grad school. (This can probably
    be expanded into reasons between the two.)

    I don't want this to be fully negative, and want to fit in reasons to
    do a PhD. It's hard to figure out where.


Potential vignettes:
- First day in the lab (at start of the semester)
- First day in the lab (for real)
    - Includes first talk
- Weekly catchup with a small group, after having done no work.
- First meeting with grad student

Internal response: *Oh god, I have no idea.
Oh jeez, oh jeez, can I defer this decision? Yes? Okay, let's do that.*

External response: "Well, I have mixed feelings about it."

It's the start of Spring 2014. I'm a sophomore and I'm taking my first two CS
upper divisions, Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence. I'm about to
get interviewed by the AI professor on whether I'd be qualifed to do research
with him.

The professor's office is in the research lab, and the lab is behind a card key
lock. After waiting 10 minutes, someone lets me in, and we start talking.

"So, what are you interested in researching?"

I don't have a good answer to that question. I vaguely like algorithms, and
have dabbled in AI by coding up game tree search for a few games, but I don't
know what to say besides that. All I know is that I want to try doing
research, because I haven't done any yet. I mumble out an incoherent reply,
and after talking more it's clear I'm not qualified. He wishes me luck in
the class, and I leave.

With no research, no relationships, almost no extracurriculars, and a barely
functioning social life, I have the freedom to put all the time I want
into schoolwork.

I get the top score on the AI final, placing sixth in the class.

The next semester, I start doing research.

\*\*\*

Just this once, let's set aside all self-deprecation and doublethink about
myself.

Objectively, I am doing very well in the Berkeley CS program.

And as someone who has more A's than B's on their transcript, everyone
eventually asks me what my future plans are. Or to be more precise, everyone
assumes my future plans are graduate school. Isn't it obvious?
Look at this man: high GPA, doing research, taking graduate classes in
junior year because he's run out of upper division courses that interest him.
That's not the face of someone who plans to work in industry, shuffling bits
day in and they out. They're an academic, through and thorugh.

Well...

On one hand, the software industry pays stupidly well. Internships at big name
companies pay $6000 or $7000 a month, well over the national average.
On average, new grads at Berkeley get offers of over $100000 base annual salary.
(LOOK UP THE STATS.) Frankly, these numbers are ridiculous.

Big name companies sell themselves by offering insane perks. Free lunch,
free dinner, we have a ball pit on campus, we have massagers on campus.
You'll never go hungry, and by the way we have
some interesting problems that need solving.

Or, you can work at a startup.
Startups sell you with the dream of changing the world, or at least the dream
of mkaing it rich. We're changing how people connect with each other.
We're changing transportation. Join now, and if we make it big you'll make it
out like a king.

How does a computer science PhD program compete with that? It sells itself
with research. In a PhD program, you will tackle the hardest problems,
the ones where no one knows the answer. You will devote the next few years
towards learning as much as you want in your quest to solve one of those problems.
It will be hard, difficult, and poorly paid, but in the end you will learn
what it feels like to truly know something.

If you're looking for money, grad school isn't for you. You'll make more in
industry, and the money lost by not working won't make up for whatever higher
salary you'll get aftewards.

If you want to coast through life with a reasonable living salary, grad school
isn't for you. You'll live, but you'll live cheaply, and you certainly won't
coast in a PhD program.

The only valid reason to go to CS grad school is because you want to do research.

Well, that makes answering the title question easier.
Did I want to do research sophomore spring? Yes! Definitely!

Do I want to do research now? Uh, maybe. I'm not sure. Let me think about it.

First day in the lab. I'm meeting with a grad student to figure out what topics
I can do research in. He asks me how much I know about neural nets. Huh.
What are those?

He explains that you take some input state, apply a linear function to it,
apply a nonlinearity to that output, repeat it a few times, and get something
that works on a wide range of problems. I don't understand why this should work,
and he admits that a lot of things about neural nets aren't well understood.
After the brief introduction, he mentions a few topics that are interesting,
and I latch onto the problem of learning how to efficiently search an exponentially
large state space to find good outcomes.

First week in the lab. I've got an account on one of desktops in the lab. The
lab's pretty big, around 30-40 computers total. I'm not sure where to start, but
I know that when people do research, they write papers. I start reading releveant
papers and work through the tutorials on Theano for building neural nets.

Meanwhile, I overhear the most incomprehensible things.

"Hey, do you understand recurrent neural nets?"

"Kind of? I implemented one a while back."

"Okay, that's better than me. Mind helping me understand LSTMs?"

The words wash over me, and I try not to let it discourage me. I've just
started, there's no way I should know what they're talking about. Okay, now
how does this sample code work?

Two hours later, I don't feel any closer to getting things, and I have to go to
class. Okay, that's also fine. I'll try more later.

The same song and dance continues for the next two weeks. I go to the weekly
group meeting, and get lost on literally the first slide. I start reading
the literature, and get daunted at all the impressive results I see. During my
one-on-one meeting, I mention that it feels like the problem I was working on
was already solved, and the graduate student has to gently remind me that
things aren't true just because someone writes a paper about it. All that means
is that the method works on exactly the problems mentioned in the paper, and
probably fails on a few problems that the authors didn't include.
After hearing that, and after reading The Control Group Is OUt Of Control (LINK),
I start treating papers as guidelines instead of cold hard truth, but that
doesn't help me stop drowning as I realize how deep everything goes.

It takes me two weeks to realize I can (and should) be implementing an
algorithm straight out of the AI course I took. It's simple, it might work, and
it's better than nothing.

It takes me another two weeks to understand and implement my first neural net in
Theano.

Graduate school demands you to be excellent.

Many people apply for graduate school programs
at top universities. Most people who get accepted have 3.5 GPA or higher, even
with difficult course loads.
At this point GPA stops mattering, because all admissions really cares about
is the prior research experience. Well, then it gets crazier, because
every applicant will have quite a bit of research and a solid recommendation.
There's self selection, because people who aren't strong academically or don't
have research will not even be interested in graduate school.
For AI, this is especially bad, because AI is an incredibly hot field. (CITE HERE)
AI and Algorithms make up over half of all applicants to CS PhD programs,
which makes competition especially fierce.
We're talking almost perfect 4.0, first or second author on a publication,
researched their topic for two years in undergrad, the works.
The good ones (or lucky ones) get in, and start their journey.

At least a quarter of them will drop out.

That's not a joke. It's the CMU drop out rate as of 2014. You need incredible
talent and dedication to even get into a program as good as CMU, and even
those people, that brilliant collection of budding researchers, a quarter of them
won't finish their PhD.

To me, the further up academia you go, the tighter the funnel gets. The top
performers in high school are average in college. The top performers in undergrad
are average as grad students. The top grad students are average as professors,
of which some are tenure track and some are not. There is no top, *it keeps
going*.

It takes a very confident person to believe they can make it all the way
up the hierarchy, and it takes a very dedicated person to actually do so.

Where does that leave me? How am I supposed to handle it when I know several people
who have publications, and everyone around me is talking one level over my head?

(Cut below paragraph, move ideas around.)

Once you get up that high, almost everyone has inferiority complexes (???) and
stays humble, and now they're asked to prove they're the shiniest diamond in all
the land. It's a staggeringly tall order, and the prospects if you aren't
near the top seem especially bad. Around a quarter of adjunct faculty are on
food stamps, and that's assuming you can even find one at all. Alternatively,
you can apply for a CS research lab, but I've heard those are as competitive
as getting faculty positions.

\*\*\*

Two hour break between lectures. That leaves enough time to fit in a bit
of research. A novel idea pops into my head. I do a literature check, and find my
exact idea in a paper from eight years ago.

Confidence runs through me
Another researcher had the same idea, and they got a paper out of it!
Maybe I'm not a fraud after all. I spend the rest of the week reading and
implementing.

Then, it all goes wrong. All my classes ramp up at the same time.
I spend my days going to lecture and my nights doing homework and projects,
Sorry research, I don't have time for you. I need to learn about thread schedulers
and clopen sets and infinite-dimensional vector spaces and Jacobians and
you need to wait. You have to wait. Please.

By the end of the week, I've done literally no research.
I sheepishly try to cobble something together in time for my one-on-one, but
I can't do much with no new ideas and no new code.

In my meeting, I hear disappointment in his words, and I can't
tell if he's actually disappointed or if I'm adding my self-loathing into
his speech because that's what I want to hear. I have time that afternoon,
but I go home instead, because I'm in too bad a mood to work effectively.

Instead of catching up on work or catching up with friends, I lie on my bed
and stare at the ceiling, thoughts swirling in my head.

*You're pushing yourself too hard. You need to slow down.*

*Or maybe*, says another voice, *maybe you weren't pushing yourself enough,
and now you are. Do you believe in growth through adversity or not?*

*I do. I really do. That doesn't mean I can't push myself too much.*

Research is hard.

No one, not even the most brilliantly arrogant people I know, has ever said
otherwise. Professors talk about the long hours, 60 to 80 hour work weeks,
and for most of the time you're stuck on a problem.
By failing so many times, you learn something, but it can be hard to see the upside
when you can only say what doesn't work instead of what does.

As an undergrad, I found this even worse, because I was so used to the problem
solving from math competitions and courses.
Given a choice between a several hour homework problem, and a research problem
that takes
20 hours optimistically and years pessimistically, it's a lot easier to choose
the homework instead.

The blessing and curse of the Information Age is that if you want to
learn something, you can. Ever wondered what gerrymandering was? Here, go
to Wikipedia. What about World War II? Well, that's covered too, in volumes and
volumes of books, and also in a few comics, and also in an anime.

One day, I find out Orson Scott Card's political views clash with your own.
The work is divided from the author, but it slightly colors how you perceive
any novels he writes. The next, I read that if the US had invaded Cuba during the Cuban
Missile Crisis, Fidel Castro would have ordered a nuclear attack, even knowing
he would have died to the reply.

One day I binge read PhD Comics and The PhD Grind, and the bleak picture of
academia is exposed to my eyes for the first time.

When it comes to graduate school, you don't have to look very hard to find the
black humor. You also don't have to look very hard to find stories that are
dark with no laughs. Similar refrains come up.

> "I'm doing research in something that I can't even explain to people I know"
>
> "Here I am, stuck with no progress after five months,
> while my friends have jobs, families, and money."
>
> "Pulled an all-nighter for that paper deadline. Can't even crash the next day,
> too many other things to finish."

The PhD grind is especially effective in portraying the grinding conditions
the author went through. PhD Comics is hyperbolic for the sake of comedy,
but The PhD Grind is real. I consider it required material if you want to
learn what a PhD can really mean.

Together, they paint a gloomy picture of academia. In academia, you voluntarily
are taking low pay and long hours in the name of research. Or as said by
(CITE), "A PhD costs you around a house."

So, if it sounds so bad, why was choosing not to go to graduate school such a
hard decision?

Research can be depressing and relentless, but it's still science.


A lot of sections resonated with me, but my favorite was this one.

> I discovered over the past 5 years that I love being a spectator of
> research, but the burden of being a continual producer of new research is
> just too great for me.



That's the problem. That's the root cause of all my indecision. People take
a lot of technology for granted, but when I step back and take a look, **really**
take a look, it is completely baffling that we can do the things we can today.
Speech recognition went from garbage to in every smartphone. Image classification
went from a pipe dream to a reality that companies are fighting tooth and nail
over. The rate of progress is unbelieveable, and it seems like every 2-3 months
there's a new breakthrough that pushes the scope of human knowledge every
so slightly outward.

Then I sit down and try to do research, and make only incremental progress after
several months of work.

The machine of research is a beautiful piece of work, and it can be gratifying to
know you are literally building the future, but in the end you're still just
one cog in a mass of gears and wires.
