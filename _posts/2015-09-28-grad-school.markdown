Outline

    The goal is to tie the personal stories into the greater reasoning of how I
    feel about grad school. It makes most sense to do stories chronologically,
    and that should guide the general passages.
    - Beginning, where I don't know what research is like
    - Starting research for first time. Imposter feelings, trying to keep up.
    - Middle section. Don't have the time, too busy, too much work.
    - Get some interesting data.
    - That Friday night.
    - End: go to a group meeting, actually understand most of it. Book ends
    the first group meeting I go to?
    - Or, I can book end with my final talk with the professor.

    General passages:
    - Imposter syndrome.
    - The work/feeling of always having more to do.
    - Potential impact between industry and grad school. (This can probably
    be expanded into reasons between the two.)

    I don't want this to be fully negative, and want to fit in reasons to
    do a PhD. It's hard to figure out where.


Potential vignettes:
- First day in the lab (at start of the semester)
- First day in the lab (for real)
    - Includes first talk
- Weekly catchup with a small group, after having done no work.
- First meeting with grad student

I chose not to apply to grad school this year.

It seems like everyone I know assumed my future plans were graduate school,
so I want to explain why it was never inevitable, depite whatever it may have
looked like.

**Spring semester, 2014**

I'm a sophomore taking my first upper division courses, Algorithms and
Artificial Intelligence. I applied to a few research postings, because
so far I had done well and it seemd like The Thing To Do.
Surprisingly, I actually get a reply from the professor of the AI
course.

Right away, it feels like I don't belong. He interviews all candidates in
person, except his office is in the research lab, and I don't have card
key access. I end up waiting outside the door for five minutes before someone
lets me in.

We sit down, and the first thing out of his mouth is
"So, what are you interested in researching?"

I don't have a good answer. I like algorithms. I like AI. That's why I signed
up for those upper divisions. I have no idea what research is, and I say as much.
After talking more, it's clear I'm not qualified right now.
He wishes me luck in the class, and I leave.

With no research, no relationships, almost no extracurriculars, and a barely
functioning social life, I have the freedom to put all the time I want
into schoolwork.

I get the top score on the AI final.

The next semester, I start doing research.

\*\*\*
{: .centered}

I don't like to brag about my academic accomplishments. In high school, I used to
care more, but in college I've tried to make a conscious shift towards whether
I learned the material, instead of whether I've learned exactly what appears on
the final. Those two goals don't always align with each other. I have leaned
towards the grade a lot more than I should, and it definitely feels like
I would know more if I didn't study towards the test so much.

That being said, I do need to explain why people thought I was going to grad school.
I have more As than Bs on my transcript. Some of those As are A+s.
I've taken four technicals every semester, which is rare but not uncommon.
(Okay, I only did three this semester, but in my defense it was my first time TAing.)
I started taking graduate CS courses
in junior year, because I ran out of upper divisions I was interested in.

So from the outside, it really, really does not look like I plan to go into
industry. I must be an academic, through and through.

That's what it looks like. In reality, I have no earthly idea if I am.

Getting good grades shows you have good work ethic or good talent.

It shows you have the potential to be a good researcher. It doesn't make you one.

**Fall semester, 2014**

First day in the lab. I meet with a grad student to figure out what topics
I can do research in. He asks me how much I know about neural nets.

Huh. What are those?

"The basic idea is to take your input features, apply a linear transformation,
then apply a nonlinear function to that. If you repeat this enough times, it
can solve a wide range of problems."

I don't understand why this works
and he admits that a lot of things about neural nets aren't well understood.
We talk a bit more, and I decide to study search methods.

A few days later, I get an account on a lab machine.
I'm not sure where to start, but I know that when people do research, they write
papers, so I start there.
As I read the literature and work through neural net tutorials, I overhear
some discussion.

"Hey, do you understand recurrent neural nets?"

"Kind of? I implemented one a while back."

"Okay, that's better than me. Mind helping me understand LSTMs?"

I don't understand a word of it. I try not to let it discourage me. I've just
started, there's no way I should know what they're talking about.

Two hours later, I don't feel any closer to getting things, and I have to go to
class. That's fine. I'll try more later.

The same song and dance continues for the next two weeks. I go to the weekly
group meeting, and get lost on literally the first slide.
During my one-on-one meeting, I mention that my problem feels well-solved because
of how many papers there are on it, and the graduate student has to gently
remind me that a research paper doesn't make something true. A paper means
exactly what it says; the method used works on exactly the experiments in the
paper, and may or may not work anywhere else. My faith in scientific studies
drops dramatically. (It bottoms out after I read The Control Group Is Out Of
Control (LINK).)
I start treating papers as guidelines for promising ideas, but there's still
a vast ocean of prior work, and that mindset doesn't help me swim.

It takes me two weeks before I feel ready to even write any code.

It takes me another two weeks to write my first neural net in Theano.

\*\*\*

Research is hard.

No one, not even the most brilliantly arrogant people I know, has ever said
otherwise. Professors talk about the long hours, 60 to 80 hour work weeks,
and for most of the time you're stuck on a problem. Of course, you're
not really stuck, because by failing so many times, you learn when an approach
doesn't work. Still, it can be hard to see the upside when you have no positive
results.

This makes scientific research a fundamentally different problem from homework.
The nicest quote explaining this is from the book "Countdown", describing
a speech Andrew Wiles gave at the International Math Olympiad.

> Solving Olympiad problems is not like doing mathematical research and is not
> necessarily the best training for research. Working at the mathematical
> frontiers is more like a marathon than a sprint. Problems can take many years to solve,
> and you never know for sure whether you're going to make the finish line. "The
> transition from a sprint to a marathon requires a new kind of stamina and a
> profoundly different test of character," he said. "We admire someone who can win
> a gold medla in four successive Olympic Games, not so much for the raw talent
> as for the strength of will and determinatino to purse a goal over such a
> sustained period of time. [...] You can forget the idea, if you ever had it,
> that all you require is a bit of natural genius and that then you can wait for
> inspiration to strike."

I read "Countdown" in high school, but the sheer difficulty of research
still blindsided me. It led to me not doing as much research as I should have.
Given a choice between a two hour homework problem and a two month
research problem, it was a lot easier for me to choose the former.

\*\*\*

Two hour break between lectures. That leaves enough time to fit in a bit
of research. A novel idea pops into my head. I do a literature check, and find my
exact idea in a paper from eight years ago.

Confidence runs through me
Another researcher had the same idea, and they got a paper out of it!
Maybe I'm not a fraud after all. I spend the rest of the week reading and
implementing.

Then, it all goes wrong. All my classes ramp up at the same time.
I spend my days going to lecture and my nights doing homework and projects,
Sorry research, I don't have time for you. I need to learn about thread schedulers
and clopen sets and infinite-dimensional vector spaces and Jacobians and
you need to wait. You have to wait. Please.

By the end of the week, I've done literally no research.
I sheepishly try to cobble something together in time for my one-on-one, but
I can't do much with no new ideas and no new code.

In my meeting, I hear disappointment in his words, and I can't
tell if he's actually disappointed or if I'm adding my self-loathing into
his speech because that's what I want to hear. I have time that afternoon,
but I go home instead, because I'm in too bad a mood to work effectively.

Instead of catching up on work or catching up with friends, I lie on my bed
and stare at the ceiling, thoughts swirling in my head.

*You're pushing yourself too hard. You need to slow down.*

*Or maybe*, says another voice, *maybe you weren't pushing yourself enough,
and now you are. Do you believe in growth through adversity or not?*

*I do. I really do. That doesn't mean I can't push myself too much.*

\*\*\*

Graduate school demands you to be excellent.

Although anybody can apply for graduate school, not everybody can get in.
As I understand it, these are the implicit requirements for top
CS graduate schools.

- A high GPA. It doesn't have to be perfect, a 3.5 GPA won't raise any
questions and anything above it is at best a small bonus.
- Prior research with a professor. If you do not have this, you will 100% not
get in. In the best case, your research leads to
a publication, but depending on the subfield this is not required.
If you're applying for AI or machine learning, the standards are much higher
because so many (almost 50%) of applicants try for these fields.
One publication or one paper under review is almost expected.
- Three letters of recommendation.
A common mix is a strong letter from your PI, an okay letter from the course
you TAed, and a weak letter from the course you did well in. Again, stronger
applicants will have two research letters, or maybe even three.

http://graddecision.org/SpecialCircumstance_CS.html

This is an incredibly demanding funnel. I don't have hard numbers, but for the
sake of argument let's guess the top 10% of CS students at Berkeley meet
these qualifications. They apply,
the good ones (or the lucky ones) (or actually, both) get in, and they start
a PhD.

A quarter of them will drop out of the PhD. (This is the estimated CMU
drop out rate, circa 2014.)

You need incredible talent and dedication to even get into a program as good
as CMU, to make it through the application filter, and a quarter of them
won't finish.

People call academia an ivory tower, but if anything it's an ivory spire.
The top high schoolers are average undergrads.
The top undergrads are average graduate students.
The top graduate students are average professors, and getting a tenure-track
position in the first place is hard. Then you need to lobby for tenure,
then you need to compete for grant money, and it keeps going. There is no top
to the spire, because the people who make it high enough have become so
enlightened that they recognize the top *doesn't actually exist.* It's an
illusion that distracts you from actually doing research.

It takes a very confident person to believe they can make it all the way
up the spire. It takes a very dedicated person to actually do so.

These are both awful realizations if you have imposter syndrome like I do.

Off the top of my head, I can name several people smarter than me. (I met
them in high school, and they've been better han me since.) I can name
a few undergrads with first author publications. (They work in the same
lab I do, but they've worked longer and harder than I have.) It's to the point
where I base my self worth not on where I am in relation to others, but on where
I am in relation to my own standards, because relative ranking will only leave
you disappointed. Not everybody can be Elon Musk. That's not saying I do this
successfully, but I try.

The point is that when I surround myself with people better than me, I lose the
ability to rank myself. Am I doing well in the Berkeley CS program? Yeah! Objectively,
I'm doing very well. Subjectively, I still feel like an idiot who spends way too
much time doing who knows what.

\*\*\*

**Spring semester, 2015**

New semester, same problems. Four more technical classes to juggle, and more
deadlock in my research. Four classes is pushing it if I want to do good
research, but I love my classes too much to drop any of them.
Does learning Kolmogorov complexity help my research? No. Absolutely not.
Proving the existence of incompressible strings is still super awesome.

I put in hours where I can, but my schedule is busy, and once again I can't
put in as many as I'd like. Still, I have some interesting results, showing
that with enough training time (on the order of running it overnight)
I can get a program to self-learn heuristics for playing Connect Four.
It's not amazing, but I have trouble beating it, so it's at least okay.

However, the approach I'm trying fundamentally requires lots of computation
time, and running experiments is becoming infeasible. I can't make more progress
until I find a way to make my experiments run faster.

These are the thoughts in the back of my head, while I wait in line for free
food. At Berkeley, the demand for CS internships is so high that companies
give free dinner, T-shirts, stickers, and other free stuff at their info sessions.
It's pocket change for them, and hungry CS students are totally okay with the
bait. I'm waiting with a few other people from the CS honor societies. Some
are 100% doing grad school, some are 100% not doing grad school. A few are on
the fence, like me.

"What are we even doing with our lives? Is waiting in line for 20 minutes really
worth it for free food?"

"Well, I'm here to get used to the grad student life. Why are you here, Mister
I Already Accepted A Full Time Offer In Industry?"

"You know, I don't really know. Force of habit, I guess."

We laugh, and no one acknowledges the financial commentary. We all
already know it's true, and it doesn't need repeating.

\*\*\*


On one hand, the software industry pays stupidly well. Internships at big name
companies pay $6000 or $7000 a month, well over the national average.
On average, new grads at Berkeley get offers of over $100000 base annual salary.
(LOOK UP THE STATS.) Frankly, these numbers are ridiculous.

Big name companies sell themselves by offering insane perks. Free lunch,
free dinner, we have a ball pit on campus, we have massagers on campus.
You'll never go hungry, and by the way we have
some interesting problems that need solving.

Or, you can work at a startup.
Startups sell you with the dream of changing the world, or at least the dream
of mkaing it rich. We're changing how people connect with each other.
We're changing transportation. Join now, and if we make it big you'll make it
out like a king.

How does a computer science PhD program compete with that? It sells itself
with research. In a PhD program, you will tackle the hardest problems,
the ones where no one knows the answer. You will devote the next few years
towards learning as much as you want in your quest to solve one of those problems.
It will be hard, difficult, and poorly paid, but in the end you will learn
what it feels like to truly know something.

If you're looking for money, grad school isn't for you. You'll make more in
industry, and the money lost by not working won't make up for whatever higher
salary you'll get aftewards.

If you want to coast through life with a reasonable living salary, grad school
isn't for you. You'll live, but you'll live cheaply, and you certainly won't
coast in a PhD program.

The only valid reason to go to CS grad school is because you want to do research.

Well, that makes answering the title question easier.
Did I want to do research sophomore spring? Yes! Definitely!

Do I want to do research now? Uh, maybe. I'm not sure. Let me think about it.



The blessing and curse of the Information Age is that if you want to
learn something, you can. Ever wondered what gerrymandering was? Here, go
to Wikipedia. What about World War II? Well, that's covered too, in volumes and
volumes of books, and also in a few comics, and also in an anime.

One day, I find out Orson Scott Card's political views clash with your own.
The work is divided from the author, but it slightly colors how you perceive
any novels he writes. The next, I read that if the US had invaded Cuba during the Cuban
Missile Crisis, Fidel Castro would have ordered a nuclear attack, even knowing
he would have died to the reply.

One day I binge read PhD Comics and The PhD Grind, and the bleak picture of
academia is exposed to my eyes for the first time.

When it comes to graduate school, you don't have to look very hard to find the
black humor. You also don't have to look very hard to find stories that are
dark with no laughs. Similar refrains come up.

> "I'm doing research in something that I can't even explain to people I know"
>
> "Here I am, stuck with no progress after five months,
> while my friends have jobs, families, and money."
>
> "Pulled an all-nighter for that paper deadline. Can't even crash the next day,
> too many other things to finish."

The PhD grind is especially effective in portraying the grinding conditions
the author went through. PhD Comics is hyperbolic for the sake of comedy,
but The PhD Grind is real. I consider it required material if you want to
learn what a PhD can really mean.

Together, they paint a gloomy picture of academia. In academia, you voluntarily
are taking low pay and long hours in the name of research. Or as said by
(CITE), "A PhD costs you around a house."

So, if it sounds so bad, why was choosing not to go to graduate school such a
hard decision?

Research can be depressing and relentless, but it's still science.


A lot of sections resonated with me, but my favorite was this one.

> I discovered over the past 5 years that I love being a spectator of
> research, but the burden of being a continual producer of new research is
> just too great for me.



That's the problem. That's the root cause of all my indecision. People take
a lot of technology for granted, but when I step back and take a look, **really**
take a look, it is completely baffling that we can do the things we can today.
Speech recognition went from garbage to in every smartphone. Image classification
went from a pipe dream to a reality that companies are fighting tooth and nail
over. The rate of progress is unbelieveable, and it seems like every 2-3 months
there's a new breakthrough that pushes the scope of human knowledge every
so slightly outward.

Then I sit down and try to do research, and make only incremental progress after
several months of work.

The machine of research is a beautiful piece of work, and it can be gratifying to
know you are literally building the future, but in the end you're still just
one cog in a mass of gears and wires.
