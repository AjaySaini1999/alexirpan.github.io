UGGGHHH GOT DISTRACTED

Okay here's the cliff notes to myself.

"So, how do you feel about grad school."

*Oh god. Oh jeez, oh jeez, can I deflect this? Yes? Okay, let's deflect this.*

"Well, I have mixed feelings about it."


(god that's so tacky. Haven't I used that gimmick enough?)

Unforunately, I still haven't made up my mind on how I feel about grad school.
There's a lot of reasons why...

There's a perpetual question among CS majors at Berkeley: do you plan to
go into industry, or go to grad school? I have never heard so much angst about
grad school outside of the major, and for good reason: industry pays stupidly
well. The claims of a computer science bubble are widespread, and although I
haven't thought about it enough to give an opinion, the facts are still the same.
CS graduates from Berkeley can average over 6 figures (check). Hell, internships
for CS students pay well over the average. Big name companies sell you with
perks and the promise of interesting problems. Startups sell you with the dream
of making a difference in the world, and that slim chance you make it out like
a king.

CS grad school sells itself with research. That's it. If you're looking for money,
grad school isn't for you. If you want to coast through life with a reasonable
living salary, grad school isn't for you. The only, only plausible reason to go
to computer science grad school is because you want to do research.

For many people, that's an immediate deal breaker. But, money isn't one of my
highest priorities, and I wouldn't know what to do if I wasn't trying to avoid
endlessly consuming content instead of creating it. So, grad school should be
a fit, right?


Welcome to Reality
--------------------------------------

The blessing (and curse) of the Information Age is that if you want to
learn about something, you can. Ever wondered what gerrymandering was? Here, go
to Wikipedia. Maybe you want to know what James Potter did for a job. Well,
this site has you covered.

Maybe you want to find out about the nuclear warheads that disappeared, whereabouts
unknown.

Maybe you want to learn about Orson Scott Card because you enjoyed *Ender's Game*,
and find out his political views clash with your own, slightly poisoning how
you read the rest of his books.

That's the difference. I don't think the world's any more or less moral than it
is now, the only difference is that the brightest and darkest moments are so much
easier to find and learn about.

(that Futurama fry meme. NOt sure if world is getting worse, or if it was always
like this and now I'm old enough to see it.)

When it comes to grad school, it's no different. You don't even have to look
very deep; read just a bit of PhD comics and you'll pick up the black humor
pretty quick. Here you are, working on your PhD, doing research in something that
you can only explain to around a few hundred and only really explain to a few tens.
Meanwhile, the outside world keeps on spinning, as everyone with "real" jobs
seems to actually be happy and unstressed...

Or, maybe you read the PhD grind, a frank account of the author's experience
going through the PhD program at Stanford. If you are at all interested in going
for a PhD, I consider it required reading material. There are a lot of comments
that resonated with me, most especially this one.

> I discovered over the past 5 years that I love being a spectator of
> research, but the burden of being a continual producer of new research is
> just too great for me.

That's the problem. That's the root cause of all my indecision. People take
a lot of technology for granted, but when I step back and take a look, **really**
take a look, it is completely baffling that we can do the things we can today.
Speech recognition went from garbage to in every smartphone. Image classification
went from a pipe dream to a reality that companies are fighting tooth and nail
over. The rate of progress is unbelieveable, and it seems like every 2-3 months
there's a new breakthrough that pushes the scope of human knowledge every
so slightly outward.

Then I sit down and try to do research, and make only incremental progress after
several months of work.

The machine of research is a beautiful piece of work, and it can be gratifying to
know you are literally building the future, but in the end you're still just
one cog in a mass of gears and wires.

There's a common refrain among professors to prospective graduate students:
"If you could be happy doing anything else, don't go into academia."

FLESH THIS OUT AND REORGANIZE IT LATER

\*\*\*

Grad school demands you to be excellent.

Here's how it goes: some number of people get into graduate school programs
at top universities. The vast majority have GPAs very close to 4.0, have prior
research experience, and have an idea of what they want to do research in.
At least a quarter of them will drop out, possibly with an MS.
(That's the CMU drop out rate as of 2014.)

When going into top universities like Berkeley for undergrad, people talk about
how they were the top of their class in high school, and now they have to
get used to being average. The same logic applies to graduate school, but
now the standard for "average" is a 3.5 GPA from a top university. Then, you need
to somehow standout among that crowd when looking for faculty positions to snag
a tenure-track position instead of an adjunct, then need to stand out for tenure...
Once you get up that high, almost everyone has inferiority complexes (???) and
stays humble, and now they're asked to prove they're the shiniest diamond in all
the land. It's a staggeringly tall order, and the prospects if you aren't
near the top seem especially bad. Around a quarter of adjunct faculty are on
food stamps, and that's assuming you can even find one at all. Alternatively,
you can apply for a CS research lab, but I've heard those are as competitive
as getting faculty positions.
