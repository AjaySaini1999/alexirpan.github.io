When I was growing up, I saved every bit of schoolwork I ever made. I did
this because my parents told me too. I'm guessing they wanted to have the
memories. Every worksheet and notebook sat in a cardboard box, under our
dinner table, a time capsule from kindergarten onwards.

Well, in the summer after 7th grade, those boxes were full, and my parents
wanted to clean up the house. I was around 13 years old, and turns out 13 year
olds don't need everything they had when they were 6. (Shocking, I know.)
My mom gave me a pile of stuff, and told me to figure out what I wanted to
keep, and what I wanted to throw out. After I finished, I was to do the
same with my old schoolwork.

What neither of us knew was that my dad had already taken the box (*my* box)
of schoolwork, and had thrown the whole thing away, box and all.

Was I upset? Well, yeah! I'm sure a lot of embarassing, adorable stuff was
in there. But, I wasn't upset enough to dig through a dumpster, so I let it
go. The one resolution I made was that I would never
throw out any of my schoolwork again. Not until I got a chance to look through
it myself.

I actually managed to keep this up all the way through college. Today, I
decided it was time to mine through it, to see what gold I could find.

It turned out my dad had the right idea after all. I wanted almost none of it!
It's funny, it all seemed to matter so much at the time. After a few years,
it just doesn't.

The bulk of it is homework answers. I threw out all of that, because 90% of them
refer to questions from a textbook I no longer own. I had a practice of selling
most of my textbooks at the end of the year, to stop the textbook bureaucracy
from extracting money from students.

Of the college section that isn't homework, it's primarily notes from my
computer science courses. That's to be expected, it's what I majored in. There,
the problem was that I already see it in my day-to-day work. I don't need my
old notes on Python, data structures, and linear algebra. I get enough of that
already. Freaking tech jobs. If I have to use one more hash table, I'm going
to flip out. (Just kidding, hash tables are the one true data structure. If
you disagree, you have yet to see the light.)

The funny thing is, the stuff I decided to keep was the
stuff I liked the least at the time. The humanities classes where I
wrote terrible literary analyses. The operating systems course, where
I liked the overarching concepts, and hated the details.
The course
about music's evolution and how it intertwined with American culture,
which...okay, actually, I liked that class. I just don't remember any of it.

Even for the courses I liked, I don't remember them as well as I should.
I took a course on formal logic, where we proved that proofs work.
My notes are all Greek to me, literally and figuratively.
(There are a *lot* of symbols in logic.) Meanwhile, I don't remember
Poisson distributions as well as I should, considering how much time we spent
on them in probability theory, and although I can tell you what an SVM does,
I had forgotten the exact way you structure the optimization to maximize the
margin.

I could re-learn some of this quickly if I needed to, but the key point is that
I *haven't* needed it. So what was the point of it all?

I took those courses because I wanted to, or because they were graduation
requirements. It worked for me, and I had the luxury to afford it, but it makes
me realize how much of it is wasted time for the people who just care about
getting a high paying job. You could argue that college teaches general skills
around work ethic, socializing, time management, networking, and so on, but
shouldn't teaching that be high school's job?

The argument that rings true for me is that most people's college experience
is like this, but it isn't clear what parts of school matter for you until after
you finish it.

Despite forgetting a lot of it, I do feel that time was when I was most
"alive". I had more varied interests, was generally more curious about the world,
and went through a lot of personal growth. It's made me realize how much I miss
having 100% freedom to do whatever I wanted, without having to worry about
money or career aspirations.

It also reminded me of the time I genuinuely thought "it's all ogre now" was
an incredible meme, enough so that I wrote it on the cheat sheet for my machine
learning final. Well, no one's perfect. Luckily, I've moved on to much better
memes, like ["Call Me Maybe" + "X Gon' Give It To Ya" mashups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fegs-XVKgnM).
Four years from now, I bet I'll still like that song.
