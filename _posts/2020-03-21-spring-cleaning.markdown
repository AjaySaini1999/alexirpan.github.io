When I was growing up, my parents asked me to bring them every piece of
schoolwork I did, so that they could save it for later. It all went into a
cardboard moving box that sat under our dinner table. Everything from
kindgarten and onwards was in that box, a time capsule of my days at
school.

Well, after 7 years of this, those boxes were full, and my parents wanted
to throw out their old junk. My mom gave me a pile of stuff, and told me
to figure out what I wanted to keep and what I wanted to throw out. After
I finished, I was to do the same with my old schoolwork. What neither of us
knew was that my dad had already taken that box under our dinner table,
and came back with nothing. He had thrown it all away, box and all.

Was I upset? Well, yeah! I'm sure a lot of embarassing, adorable stuff was
in there. But I wasn't upset enough to dig through a dumpster to find it,
so I let it go. The one resolution I made was that I would never, ever
throw out any of my schoolwork again. I would keep it forever and always,
until the next round of spring cleaning.

I actually managed to keep this up all the way through college, and for
years I've had a giant stack of papers in my room at all times. Today, I
decided it was time to mine through it, to see what gold I could find.

Guess what? I wanted almost none of it! A bunch of it was answers to
problem sets, except without the question, because I was reading the
question from a textbook I sold second-hand at the end of the year.
Then, for the college section, a lot of it was about computer science
things I didn't want to look at anymore. I don't need my old notes
on Python, data structures, linear algebra, and partial derivatives.
I see enough of that already.

What surprised me the most was that the stuff I decided to keep was the
stuff I liked the least at the time. The humanities classes where I
wrote terrible literary analysis. The operating systems course, where
I liked learning the concepts, and hated learning the details. The course
about music's evolution with American culture, which...okay, actually,
that class was cool, but I don't remember much of it. In fact, as I looked
through my college notes, I don't even remember the parts that I really
should. Most of my probability theory notes read as gibberish to me. I could
probably re-teach myself pretty quickly, I recognized some keywords, but at
the same time I should really know Poisson distributions better than I actually
do.

It's given me a lot to think about. What did I actually learn in college, if
I don't remember so much of it? I took a course on formal logic (proving
that proofs work), and looking at my notes, it's all Greek to me (literally
and figuratively).
