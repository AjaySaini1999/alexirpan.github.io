This is the story of how I didn't get publishable results in time for a
Nov 8th NIPS workshop deadline. Astute readers will note that deadline is
two days from now, but I'm very confident it isn't happening.

It'll be very light on details. One, I'm trying to target a broader audience.
Two, I do need to be somewhat confidential
about what I'm working on. Most importantly, three: the details
don't matter.

I first had my research idea in late September.

I was (and still am) generally interested in reinforcement learning, and more
specifically ways to make RL more sample efficient. There were some research
threads I was keeping an eye on, and it felt like I was on the cusp of
something. So, I spent two days thinking it through. This was happening
a few weeks after a CFAR workshop, and therefore I tried to make it as bulletproof
as possible. What is the exact research question I'm trying to solve?
How does my idea differ from state of the art methods? Why are those
differences going to make it perform better?
What is the fastest experiment I can set up to get useful data to adjust my
research trajectory?
Assume something goes wrong - what's the most likely failure point, and how
surprised am I if it fails?

After spending most of a day thinking it through, I spent most of the next day
writing it up into a research proposal. Sent it out end of Friday, come back
next Monday, and to my surprise, the feedback is positive. People have
suggestions, but experienced researchers all believe in the idea.

This is both incredibly exciting and incredibly terrifying. It's *my*
idea, and they all think it has promise. This sets off a ton of alarm
bells.

* I own this idea, therefore the success of this idea is a measure of my
research ability.
* I came up with this idea, but that doesn't mean others can't come up with
the same idea. In fact, it is very likely another researcher has come up with
the same idea. It's a natural extension of existing work, and thoughts aren't
as novel as people think they are.

Believe whatever you want about these claims. They're what I believe, on
a structural level, and it leads to a simple conclusions.

* If I do not push on this idea right now, I'm going to get scooped, and
I'll continue to be a failure of a researcher.

The last point needs some elaboration.

I did undergraduate research for 2 years, then somehow conned enough people
into thinking I knew enough about neural nets to land an industry job that
lets me do research. In all this time, I've never published a paper.

And now, I feel like the clock is ticking. Like I only got this position
because my professor put a good word in - which works for now, but I can't
coast on that for long. If I want to keep doing research, I need to show,
unequivocally, that I'm qualified for this. And that means publishing a paper,
and getting it accepted into a top machine learning conference. If I can't do
that after that many years of research, how am I ever going to convince someone
I can do deep learning research? Everyone wants to get into deep learning; it's
up to me to grab the opportunities that have fallen into my lap and **shove**
them as far as I can.

This mindset is really stressful, and I hate it, and I don't want it to go away,
because it feels like I wouldn't be able to do anything without it.

Okay, now here's the kicker. The next big conference deadline is ICLR, which is
November 4th. That gives me just over a month to turn my idea into a paper.

*Holy shit.*
