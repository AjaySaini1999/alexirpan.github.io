Here is a lesson that should be obvious: if you are trying to hit a paper
deadline, going to Mystery Hunt the weekend before that deadline is a bad idea.
In my defense, I did not think we were submitting to ICML, but some last-minute
results convinced us it was worth trying.

Combined with the huge airport troubles getting out of Boston, I ended
up landing in California at 11 AM the day before the deadline, with the
horrible combination of a ruined sleep schedule and a lack of sleep in the first
place. But, now I've recovered, and finally have time to talk about
Hunt.

I hunted with teammate this year. It's an offshoot of ✈✈✈ Galactic
Trendsetters ✈✈✈, leaning towards the CMU and Berkeley contingents of the team.
Like Galactic, the team is pretty young, mostly made of people in their 20s.
When deciding between Galactic and teammate, I chose teammate because I expected
it to be smaller and more serious. We ended up similar in size to Galactic. No
idea where all the people came from.

Overall feelings on Hunt can be summed up as, "Those puzzles were great, but I
wish we'd finished." Historically, if multiple teams finish Mystery Hunt,
Galactic is one of those teams, and since teammate was of similar size and
quality, I expected teammate to finish as well. However, since Hunt was harder this year,
only one team got to the final runaround. I was a bit disappointed, but oh
well, that's just how it goes.

I did get the feeling that a lot of puzzles had more grunt work than last time
Setec ran a Hunt, but I haven't checked this. This is likely colored by hearing
stories about [First You Visit Burkina Faso](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/first_you_visit_burkina_faso.html),
and spending an evening staring at
Google Maps for [Caressing](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/caressing.html) and carefully cutting out dolls for [American Icons](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/american_icons.html).
(I heard that when we finally solved First You Visit Burkina Faso, the person
from AD HOC asked "Did you like your trip to Burkina Faso?", and we replied
"Fuck no!")

What I think actually happened was that the puzzles were less backsolvable and
the width of puzzle unlocks was smaller. Each puzzle unlocked a puzzle or a
town, and each town started with 2 puzzles, so the width only increased when a
new town was discovered. I liked this, but it meant we couldn't skip puzzles
that looked time-consuming, they had to be done, especially if we didn't know
how the meta structure worked.

For what it's worth, I think it's good to have some puzzles with lots of
IDing and data entry, because these form footholds that let everybody contribute
to a puzzle. It just becomes overwhelming if there's too much of it, so you have
to be careful.


Before Hunt
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting from here, there are more substantial puzzle spoilers.

A few weeks before Hunt, someone had found Alex Rosenthal's TED talk about Mystery Hunt.

<div style="max-width:854px"><div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/alex_rosenthal_the_joyful_perplexing_world_of_puzzle_hunts" width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

<p></p>

We knew Alex Rosenthal was on Setec. We knew Setec had embedded puzzle data in a
TED talk before. So when we got INNOVATED out of the TED talk, it quickly became
a teammate team meme that we should submit INNOVATED right as Hunt opened, and
that since "NOV" was a substring of INNOVATED, we should be on the lookout for a
month-based meta where answers had other month abbreviations. Imagine our
surprise when we learn the hunt is Holiday themed - month meta confirmed!

The day before Hunt, I played several rounds of [Two Rooms and a Boom](http://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/tworoomsandaboom/)
with people from Galactic. It's not puzzle related (at least, not yet), but the
game's cool enough that I'll briefly explain. It's a social deduction game. One person is the President, another
person is the Bomber, and (almost) everyone's win condition is getting the
President and Bomber in the same or different rooms by the end of the game.

Now, here's the gimmick: by same
room, I mean the literal same room. People are randomly divided across two rooms, and
periodically, each room decides who to swap with the other room. People initially have
secret roles, but there are ways to share your roles with other players, leading
to a game of figuring out who to trust, who you can't trust, and concealing who
you *do* trust from people you don't, as well as deciding how you want to ferry
information across the two rooms. It's neat.

Right before kickoff, I learned about [the Mystery Hunt betting pool](https://twitter.com/dydt/status/1085780956236046338)
one of my friends was running, thought it was fun, and chipped in, betting on
Palindrome. While waiting for puzzles to officially release, we printed our
official team [Bingo](https://www.alexirpan.com/mystery-hunt-bingo/) board.

Puzzles
-----------------------------------------------------

Every Hunt, I tend to look mostly at metapuzzles, switching to regular puzzles
when I get stuck on the metas.
This Hunt was no different. It's not the worst strategy, but I think I look at
metas a bit too much, and make bad calls on whether I should solve regular
puzzles instead.

I started Hunt by working on [GIF of the Magi](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/gif_of_the_magi.html) and
[Tough Enough](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/tough_enough.html), which were both solid puzzles.
After both of those were done, we had enough answers to start looking at [Christmas-Halloween](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/problem/christmas_halloween.html).
We got the decimal-octal joke pretty quickly, and the puzzle was easy to fill-in
with incomplete info, then gave massive backsolving fodder.
Based on the answers shared during wrap-up, several other teams had a similar
experience.

Backsolving philosophy is different across teams, and teammate borrows a culture
from Galactic - backsolve as much as you want, as long as you wait for your answer to be confirmed wrong
before trying it for the next puzzle, and try to have only 1 pending answer per
puzzle.
This makes our solve accuracy relatively terrible since our frequent backsolve
attempts drag down the average. For example, we guessed several random words for
[Moral
Ambiguity](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/moral_ambiguity.html),
because we knew it thematically and mechanically had to be the Holi Day prank answer.

We got feedback to backsolve less aggressively and toned down our backsolve
strategy by a lot. In fact, we completely forgot to backsolve [Making a
Difference](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/making_a_difference.html).
This was especially embarassing because we knew the clue phrase started with
"KING STORY ADAPTED AS A FILM", and yet we completely forgot that "RITA HAYWORTH
AND THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION" was still unclaimed.

I did not work on [Haunted](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/haunted.html)
but I know people had a good laugh when the cluephrase literally told them "NOT
INNOVATED, SORT FIRST". teammate uses Discord to coordinate things. Accordingly,
our `#innovated-shitposting` channel was renamed to `#ambiguous-shitposting`.

I did not work on [Common Flavors](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/common_flavors.html), and in
fact, we backsolved that puzzle because we didn't figure out they were Celestial
Seasonings. At some point, the people working on Common Flavors tried brewing
one of the teas, tried it, and thought it tasted terrible. It couldn't possibly
be a real tea blend!

Oops.

Eventually they cut open the tea bags and tried to identify ingredients by phonelight.

[We See Thee Rise](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/we_see_thee_rise.html) was a fun puzzle.
The realization of "oh my God, we're making the Canadian flag!"
was great. Even if our maple leaf doesn't look that glorious in Google Sheets...

![We See Thee Rise](/public/mh19/weseetheerise.png)
{: .centered }

I did not work on [The Turducken Konundrum](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/dk8_the_turducken_konundrum_turkey.html),
but based on solve stats, we got the fastest solve. I heard that we solved it
with zero backtracking, which was very impressive.

For [Your Wish is My Command](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/your_wish_is_my_command.html), our first question was
asking HQ if we needed the game ROMs of the games pictured, which would have
been illegal. We were told to "not do illegal things." I did...well, basically nothing,
because by the time I finished downloading an NES emulator, everyone else had
IDed the Game Genie codes, and someone else had loaded the ROM on an NES
emulator they had installed before Hunt. That emulator had a view for what
address was modified to what value, and we solved it quickly from there.

I want to call out the printer trickery done for [7 Little Dropquotes](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/7_little_dropquotes.html).
The original puzzle uses color to mark what rows letters came from, but if you
print it, the colors are removed for Roman numerals, letting you print the page
with a black-and-white printer. Our solve was pretty smooth, we printed out all
the dropquotes and solved them in parallel. For future reference, Nutrimatic
trivializes dropquotes, because the longer you make the word, the more likely it
is that only one word fits the regex of valid letters. This means you can use Nutrimatic on all
the long clues humans find hard, and use humans on all the short clues Nutrimatic finds hard.
When solving this puzzle, I learned I am really bad at solving dropquotes, but
really good at typing regexes into Nutrimatic and telling people "that long
word is INTELLECTUAL".

[Be Mine](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/be_mine.html) was an absurd
puzzle. I didn't have to do any of the element IDing, which was nice.
The break-in was realizing that we should fill in "night" as "nite" and
find minerals, at which point it became a silly game of "Is plumbopalladinite a
mineral? It is!" and "Wait, cupromakopavonite is a thing?" I had a lot of fun
finding mineral names and less fun extracting the puzzle answer.
I was trying to find the chemical compounds word-search style.
The person I was solving with was trying to find overlaps between a mineral
name and the elements in the grid. I didn't like this theory because some
minerals didn't extract any overlaps at all, but the word search wasn't going
great. It became clear that I was wrong and they were right.

If you like puzzlehunt encodings, [The Bill](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/the_bill.html) is the puzzle for you.
It didn't feel very thematic, but it's a very dense pile of extractions if
you're into that.

Okay, there's a story behind [State Machine](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/state_machine.html). At some point, we realized that
it was cluing the connectivity graph of the continental United States. I worked
on implementing the state machine in code while other people worked on IDing the
states. Once that was IDed, I ran the state machine and reported the results.
Three people then spent several minutes cleaning the input, each doing so in a
separate copy of the spreadsheet, because they all thought the other people were
doing it wrong or too slowly. This led to the answer
KATE BAR THE DOOR, which was...wrong. After lots of confusion, we figured out
that the clean data we converged on had assigned 0 to New Hampshire instead of 10. They had taken the final digit for every state and filtered out all the
zeros, forgetting that indicies could be bigger than 9. This was *hilarious* at
2 AM and I broke down laughing, but now it just seems stupid.

For [Middle School of Mines](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/middle_school_of_mines.html),
I didn't work on the puzzle, but I made the drive-by observation that were
drawing a giant 0 in the mines discovered so far,
in a rather literal case of "missing the forest of the threes".

I had a lot of fun with [Deeply Confused](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/deeply_confused.html). Despite literally doing deep learning in my
day job, I was embarrassed to learn that I didn't have an on-hand way to
call Inception-v3 from my laptop. We ended up using a web API anyways, because
Keras was giving us the wrong results. Looking at the solution, we forgot to
normalize the image array, which explains why we were getting wrong adversarial
class.

[Chris Chros](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/chris_chros.html) was a
fun puzzle. I never realized so many people with the name "Chris" were in
Infinity War.

[He's Out!!](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/hes_out.html) was a
puzzle that went from "huh" to "wow, neat!" when we figured
out that a punchout in baseball means a strikeout. I've never played Punch-Out!!,
but I recognized it from speedruns. A good intro is [the blindfolded run by
Sinister1 at AGDQ 2014](https://youtu.be/CvzIb53Lcno?t=507).

[Tree Ring Circus](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/tree_ring_circus.html) was neat. I felt very clever for extracting the ring sizes by
looking up their size in the SVG source. I then felt stupid when I realized this
was intentional, since it's very important to have exact ring sizes for this
puzzle.

[Cubic](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/cubic.html) was cute. It's fune
to have a puzzle where you go from, "ah, Cubic means cubic polynomials", and
see it go to "ohhhh, cubic means cubic *graphs*". I didn't really do anything
for this but it was fun to hear it get solved.

Somewhere around Sunday 2 AM, we got caught by the time unlock and starting
unlocking a new puzzle every 15 minutes. I'm not sure what exactly happened, but
the entire team somehow went into beast mode and kept pace with the time unlock
for several hours. We ended up paying for it later that morning, when everyone
crashed until noon.
One of the puzzles solved in that block was [Divine the Rule of Kings](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/divine_the_rule_of_kings.html),
which we just...did.
Like, it just happened. Really weird. There were some memes about "can someone
pull up the US state connectivity graph, again?". Turns out
puzzle authors really like that graph.

Of the regular puzzles I solved, I'd say my favorite was [Getting Digits](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/getting_digits.html).
We didn't hit all the a-has at once, it was more like a staggered process.
First "ON and OFF!", then "Ohhhh it's START", then "ohhh
it's a phone number". It's a simple extraction but there's still something cool
about calling a phone number to solve a puzzle.


Metapuzzles
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite looking at a lot of metas, I didn't contribute to many of them. The one
where I definitely helped was figuring out the turkey pardon connection for
Thanksgiving-President's Day. Otherwise, it was a bunch of observations that
needed more answers to actually execute.

This section really exists for two reasons. The first is the
Halloween-Thanksgiving meta. We were stuck for quite a while, assuming that the
meta worked by overlaying three Halloween town answers with three Thanksgiving
answers with food substrings, and extracting using blood types in some way.
This was a total red herring, since the food names were coming from turkey
names. However, according to the people who solved it,
the reason they finally tried ternary on the blood types was because we had a
bingo square for "Puzzle uses ternary in extraction", and they wanted to get
that square. I'm officially claiming partial credit for that metapuzzle.

The second reason is the Arbor-Pi meta. We had the core idea the whole time -
do something based on digits after the Feynman point. The problem was that we
horribly overcomplicated it. We decided to assign numbers to each answer, then
substitute numbers based on answer length. So far, so good. We then decided that
since there were two boxes, the answer had to be a two digit number, so we took
everything mod 100. *Then*, instead of extracting the digit N places after the
Feynman point, we thought we needed to find the digits "N" at some place after the Feynman
point, noting how many digits we had to travel to find N.
Somehow, of the 8 boxes we had, all of them gave even numbers, so it looked like *something* was
happening. This was all wrong and eventually someone did the simple thing
instead.


Post-Hunt
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We didn't get a Bingo. At least it's symmetric.

![Bingo after](/public/mh19/bingo_after.jpg)
{: .centered }

Speaking of Bingo, after Hunt ended, we talked about how we didn't get the
Magic: the Gathering square, and how it was a shame that Pi-Holi wasn't an MTG
puzzle, since it could have been about the color pie. That led to talking about
other games with colored wedges, and then we got the Trivial Pursuit a-ha.

I didn't do too much after Hunt. It was mostly spent getting food with friends,
complaining about the cold, and waiting in an airport for 12 hours. It turned
out a bunch of Bay Area Hunters were waiting for the same flights, so it wasn't
as bad as it could have been - a bunch of us talked about Hunt, and a few people
from my team got dinner at a Sbarro.

It felt obligatory.
