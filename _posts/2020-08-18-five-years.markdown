*Sorta Insightful* turns five years old today! That feels kinda weird,
because it's the longest I've spent sustaining one thing. Elementary
school was five years, middle school was three years, high school was
four years. Then undergrad was four years, and I've since been working
at Google for another four years.

Thanks for reading.
If you haven't read my previous anniversary posts, I do a meta-post
every year about blogging. This year's is, once again, a bit rushed,
because I've been working on another post about [AI timelines]({% post_url 2020-08-18-ai-timelines %}),
which I'm also releasing today.

# Statistics

## Word Count

Last year, I wrote [21,878 words]({% post_url 2019-08-18-four-years %}).

I'm pleasantly surprised to see it's so much larger. I suspect it's because
of the very long posts I wrote about puzzlehunts. Due to running a hunt this year,
I had spent a lot of time thinking about puzzlehunt design, which made those
posts relatively easy to write. Traditionally, I count posts written on August
18 for the next year's count, so I have a good head start for next year. (The
AI timelines post is about 5700 words long.)

Post length is a bad measure of output, for the same reason that lines of
code changed is a bad software engineering metric. As the Mark Twain quote goes, "If
I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter." I do think it's
a reasonable measure though, as long as I stay aware of how much time I spent
editing each post.

(Funnily enough, I just noticed I shared a Woodrow Wilson quote with the
same sentiment [last year]({% post_url 2019-08-18-four-years %}). Incredible.
Amazing. Next year I'll find a new person to cite for this. [I put odds on
using either Blaise Pascal, or Benjamin Franklin](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/04/28/shorter-letter/).)

I wrote 13 posts this year, counting the Mystery Hunt post which was split
into 2 parts. This is just over my trend of 1 post per month. Again, pleasantly
surprised by that. I can't even credit the coronavirus for this.
In general I have been
much less productive, due to having my goof-off space and work space so
close to one another. The Bay Area shelter in place order started March 17.
It has been 5 months since that order, 5 posts were written in those five months
and 8 posts were written in the seven preceding months. So yes, I was less
productive for blog writing too, but not by much.

# View Counts

These are the view counts from August 18, 2019 to today, for the posts I've written
this year.

{% endhighlight %}

This is a pretty consistent drop in view count compared to last year, about 1/3rd
the views from last year, but I don't
think that's too crazy. Many of my posts were about more obscure topics.
I'm a bit bummed my contact tracing post got so few views though, I felt that
could have been one of my more important posts. The US response has been
dysfunctional enough that it didn't really change anything, but hey, I tried.
(Not a lot, but I tried.)


## Time Spent Writing

Excluding time spent on this post, but including time spent on the AI timelines
post, I spent **116 hours, 36 minutes** writing for my blog this year. This is
more than last year but less than 2 years ago. That feels about right.

(Side note #2: Not only did I quote Woodrow Wilson / Mark Twain / whatever
in this section last year, I also made the exact same joke that it's unclear
who the quote is first attributed to! What the heck, am I really that predictable?
I really should remove both this side note and the previous one, but you know
what, I'm keeping it, the fact my mind is so repetitive is pretty interesting.)

([Me, last year]({% post_url 2019-08-18-four-years %}))
{: .centered }

I think it's literally been four years since I talked about writing that
*Gunnerkrigg Court* post. I'm no longer surprised I haven't gotten around to
it. Hopefully it will not be an ongoing meme.

Just as a quick review of last year's predicted post topics...

**Post about measurement:** 20% odds of writing before end of 2019 (I didn't), 95% odds
of writing eventually.

New odds of writing eventually: 65%. I'm starting to think that the ideas I
wanted to express are already known to the people that care about it, which makes
me less motivated to write this. I still believe it's an important topic though!

**Post about Gunnerkrigg Court:** 25% odds of writing before end of 2019 (I didn't), 70%
odds of writing eventually

New odds of writing eventually: 50%

**Post about My Little Pony:** 50% odds of writing before end of 2019 (I didn't), 85%
odds of writing eventually.

New odds of writing eventually: 90%. It's coming I swear. I thought I would be
done with My Little Pony by now, but every time I think it's over they pull
me back in.

**Post about Dominion Online:** 35% odds of writing before end of 2019 (I didn't), 85%
odds of writing eventually

New odds of writing eventually: 65%. The draft is untouched since last year,
but I can see myself visiting it again.

Based on me going 0 of 4 on my "write by end of 2019" predictions, you should
probably downgrade all those numbers a bit. My bloging rate is fairly steady.
My calibration on *what* I write about is awful.

Anyways, what are you doing reading this meta-post? Go read the
[AI timelines]({% post_url 2020-08-18-ai-timelines %}) post instead! Go tell me
why I'm an idiot or why I'm right.
