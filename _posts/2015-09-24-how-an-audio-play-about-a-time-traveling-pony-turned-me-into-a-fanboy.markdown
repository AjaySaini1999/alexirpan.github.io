Life is really unpredictable.

You know the cliche interview question,

> "Where do you see yourself in five years?"

There's the answer you're supposed to give: "At the same company, but higher up
the ladder." I've always wondered about the people who actually answer that
both honestly and confidently. How can they be so sure of where their life
will lead? People like that actually *exist?*

If you has asked me that five years ago, I'd have no idea what to say,
but I certainly wouldn't have told you I'd be writing a post
about a MLP x Doctor Who fan series.

The Short MLP Primer
----------------------------------

*My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic* is a cartoon about pastel colored horses living
lives with other pastel colored horses.

The main horse (okay, pony) is Twilight
Sparkle, a unicorn prodigy. She's incredibly smart and hard working, but
she's also a bit socially inept, and is prone to freaking out over small details.

It's surprisingly good. Although it takes a while to warm up to it, once you like the
characters the show just clicks and becomes a joy to watch.
*Friendship is Magic* starts with Twilight saving the world from eternal darkness, then shifts to
slice of life. On rare occasions, it shifts back to adventure, where the main cast have to fight monsters
that escaped Tartarus, break up communistic cults, and save kingdoms from
totalitarian dictators.

Yes, really. All of that is canon.

As for the fandom, the MLP fandom is one of the craziest and most prolific
fandoms in the world, and I proudly count myself as a member.


The Short Doctor Who Primer
----------------------------------

So. I actually haven't watched any *Doctor Who*.
Everything I know about the show is from Internet osmosis. I'll say what I know,
and apologize in advance for any *Doctor Who* misrepresentation.
(So to any Whovians reading this: please don't kill me.)

*Doctor Who* is a long running show by the BBC. I do mean long. The first episode
aired over 50 years ago.

The eponymous Doctor is a Time Lord who time travels in the TARDIS, which takes the
appearance of a London police box.
Although he looks human, he's somewhere around 1000 years old.
Whenever he dies, he regenerates into a new form and personality, which keeps the
show fresh. (That's the in-universe explanation. In reality, it's a way to change
the actor.)
Together with a companion (a human who's in on the Doctor's secret), he travels
through time and space, fighting monsters like the Daleks or the Weeping Angels.
Or, he resolves the local trouble he sees in this part of the multiverse.
Most likely,
he's doing both at the same time, all while being either a little too insane
or not insane enough.


So....Why Are There MLP x Doctor Who Crossovers?
----------------------------------

Some people noticed there was a recurring background pony with hair very similar
to David Tennant's, one of the Doctor's actors. He also had a cutie mark of an hourglass,
meaning his special talent was related to time.

Left: the pony. Right: the human. Honestly, not a slam dunk case.

When you combine those two details with the craziness of the MLP fandom,
there's only one reasonable outcome.
Fans quickly christened him "Doctor Whooves"
and to this day he's one of the most popular fan characters.

Include fanfic and you might as well add the whole cast.

The Adventure Begins
---------------------------

Among the sea of fan content was the fanfic "Number 12", by SqueakAnon. (The name
is accurate. Squeak's gender and real name are both unknown.)

Squeak's take was that Doctor Whooves was the 12th Doctor (the show
was on the 11th at the moment.) The story starts with the TARDIS crashing into
Twilight's home, and ends with Twilight becoming the Doctor's companion. It was
well received, and that was that.

A while later, Squeak decided to take it one step further. He or she contacted other
members of the fandom, and formed Pony In A Box Productions. Their mission:
to create a full-fledged radio play.
Their first episode was an adaptation of "Number 12", and ever since they've been releasing
new episodes under the banner *Doctor Whooves Adventures.*

And now we come to me. Around two years ago, I decided to listen to a few
episodes. At first, it was just entertaining, but just like with MLP, at
some point I realized Pony in a Box had stolen my heart, locked it away and threw away
the key, and I didn't even care. I love this series so, so much. I actually find
it difficult to find things I don't like about it.
*Doctor Whooves Adventures* is in my favorite works of all time list, and it's
singlehandedly convinced me to watch *Doctor Who*, as soon as I find time for the
inevitable binge.


Why Should You Watch This Show?
--------------------------------
It's funny when it wants to be, but isn't afraid to be sad.
The characters are not only well written but well acted. It mixes the two canons
well: the overarching themes of death and loss from *Doctor Who* are tempered
by themes of optimism and friendship from *My Little Pony*. Yet despite taking elements
from both, you don't need to know either *My Little Pony* or *Doctor Who* to
enjoy this series. Everything is played straight and with few fandom in-jokes,
and the cast carries the series on its own.

Below, I'm going to repeat the above, but in many, many more words. Let's get to it!


Production Values
-----------------------------

Normally, you don't expect fan creations to go through much production, which
makes the effort put into *Doctor Whooves Adventures* all the more surprising.
Pony In A Box holds themselves to high standards, and it shows. First,
the writing staff (led by Squeak) prepares a script. Then, the voice actors
record their lines.
Once done, the sound team comes in, adding background music and
sound effects. (As someone who has done very minor movie editing, this is both
more important and more time consuming than it sounds.)
At the same time, the art team creates promotional pictures. Finally, they
publish to Youtube and iTunes.
Every episode is a huge labor of love, and it shows in the end product. Here's
an excerpt showing this off. It's from "Bells of Fate", my favorite episode.
In this part, a librarian is recounting the founding of the Green Isles.

<div class="centered">
    <audio class="player" src="/public/doc-who-adv/mayhewfull.mp3" controls></audio>
</div>

Unfortunately, all that production means each episode takes
a long time to finish. I've been waiting for the conclusion to "Bells of
Fate" for over a year. Still, it's coming out soon! Meaning,
they targeted August of this year and it's the end of September...but it is happening
and I can't begrudge the team too much. I know how long these things can take.


The Writing
----------------------------------

The writing and voice acting for this series is top notch. The strength of the
vocal cast is a huge asset here, since the way they say the lines often conveys
more than the words themselves.
Because the writers can trust the voice actors, every line can focus on driving
the plot forward without sacrificing characterization. Addtionally, since the
characters are well defined, the plots can grow organically from the seeds
the writers plant, letting them avoid the "hand of god" problem. (That's my term
for when writers need to add out-of-character moments to
railroad the plot.)

The show also makes a point of having strong female
characters and a gender balanced cast. (This is true of most MLP fanwork. When a
fandom grows in open defiance of gender stereotypes, people pay a lot of attention
to avoiding them. It's a beautiful part of the community.)
Twilight's a fantastic companion; as one of the smartest ponies in MLP canon,
she might be the only character that can keep up with the Doctor. She
solves problems and gets herself out of trouble almost as often as the Doctor does,
and although the Doctor knows more about the universe than she ever will, Twilight is the one
who knows the most about the pony-filled world the Doctor landed in. They get
a great teacher-student relationship going, and it's just fun to see them play off
each other.

There's plenty of dry, deadpan situational humor as well. From
the start of "Wrong Way Backwards", where Twilight and the Doctor are shopping:

<div class="centered">
    <audio class="player" src="/public/doc-who-adv/wwb_start.mp3" controls></audio>
</div>

And although light humor is the standard tone of the show, one of the running themes is that people
(or ponies, in this case) are haunted by tragedies from their past.
From "Shadows of the Lunar Republic", the account of a lunar pony:

<div class="centered">
    <audio class="player" src="/public/doc-who-adv/lunarrepublic.mp3" controls></audio>
</div>

However, after lots of struggle, everyone gets past their tragedy and
self-loathing, moving on to better lives. That's my favorite part of the
writing. Everyone earns their happy ending, and it all ends well.
Sure, maybe that isn't realistic, but who says it has to be?


Parting Remarks
-----------------------------

If you do decided to listen to the series, I recommend listening in episode order.
Should you get bored, each story arc is only 2-3 episodes long, and there's little continuity
between them, so you're free to jump to the better episodes. Here's my short list, with
the standard your mileage may vary caveat.

- Number 12 Part 1 + 2. You absolutely need to start here, no questions. It's not
the best episode, but this introduces all the characterization, so it's unskippable.
- Bells of Fate. My favorite episode. Great mythology influences, and the two
plots tie together elegantly. (Fun fact: this episode actually got me into Irish
music.)
- Rhapsody in Blue Box. Tugs at the heartstrings more than any other. May be better
after listening to the short Cell Mates, but the story is getting told out of
order anyways. You'll be as confused as the rest of us whether you've seen the
episodes in order or not.
- Wrong Way Backwards Parts 1 + 2 + 3, then 1 + 2 + 3 to fill the gaps.
You'll see what I mean. Timey wimey,
wibbly wobbly, and all around fun. This episode's construction is
the most impressive, but it's also the longest by far, especially if you listen to
both sides.

The remaining episodes (Shadows of the Lunar Republic, Chords of Chaos,
Pony of the Opera) are ranked similarly. They're fun, but not as strong as the rest.

It's so strange to realize that five years ago, I was still in high school. So much
has changed since then. I'd like to think I got a bit smarter, but odds are
I'm still just as dumb and don't know it yet. I'll look forward to making
[another rant](http://www.alexirpan.com/2015/09/01/optimizing-process.html) in a
few years about why I was an idiot.

In five more years from now? Who knows? Maybe my love for this series will fade, but it's hard to see that happening.
Maybe *Doctor Whooves Adventures* will die a slow death, as the creators lose interest,
but I hope that never comes to pass.
The only thing I'm certain about is that I'll never be certain about how my
tastes will shift. The best I can do is to stay open to change, and to keep
reaching.

Until next time. In the words of the good Doctor himself,
