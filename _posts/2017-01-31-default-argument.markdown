The ideas here are likely old news for people who read my blog, but some
anvils need to be dropped.

Most political arguments I see fail because both parties argue from a
default position. The logic goes roughly like this.

1. I believe X.
2. The other person believes Y.
3. X is the right belief.
4. If I can show that the other person's reasons for believing Y are wrong,
they'll believe X.

The first two are prerequistes to an argument. The third is a matter of debate.
The fourth is where everything goes to shit.

Pointing out problems in other people's arguments only shows there are problems
in other people's arguments. It doesn't make your argument any more true.
