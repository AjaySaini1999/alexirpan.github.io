title:  "The Default Position Problem"

The ideas here are all old news, but some anvils need to be dropped.

Many arguments, especially political ones, fail because both parties argue from a
default position. The implicit logic goes roughly like this.

1. I believe X.
2. The other person believes Y.
3. X is the right belief.
4. If I can show that the other person's reasons for believing Y are wrong,
they'll believe X instead.

The first two are prerequistes to an argument. The third is a matter of debate.
The fourth is where everything goes to shit.

Stop me if you've heard this story before. Two people on the Internet are arguing.
One believes X, the other believes Y. The X believer comes up with a reason
someone would believe Y, then writes a scathing comment attacking it. The Y
believer comes up with a reason someone would believe X, and attacks that too.
Meanwhile, neither has addressed the actual
reason one believes X and the other believes Y.

Y supporters read all the stupid rebuttals made against X
supporters. "Wow, Y supporters think we believe X because of *that?*" X
supporters read all the stupid rebuttals made against Y supporters.
"Wow, X supporters think we believe Y because of *that?*"

Both, at least, agree on one thing. "Why should I listen to this people? Their
reasoning is garbage, and whenever you try to point it out they hurl garbage
back."

But the real problem is that you *think* their reasoning is garbage,
and they *think* your reasoning is garbage, when neither may be true.

**Your position is not the default position. No one's is.**
Pointing out problems in other people's arguments only shows there are problems
in those arguments. It doesn't make your argument any more valid.
Besides, who says your argument would stand up to the same level of scrutiny? All you've really shown
is that the people you're talking to don't have strong counterarguments. How do
you know no strong counterarguments exist? And if they do exist, why should
people believe you're any more right?

Okay, look. I'll be blunt. Some people do believe in things for stupid reasons.
The harm comes when you generalize the stupidity of some arguments to justify
ignoring all arguments. If you're an X thinker, and want to understand how
anyone could believe Y, you should assume that at some point, somebody came
up with an intellectually consistent argument for Y. (If no good argument for Y exists, how did
anyone start believing Y in the first place?)
As belief in Y spread from person to person, the original argument got muddled, like a game of
ideological [telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers).
By the time it got to your filter bubble, it's been distorted
into something weaker than it was. So don't generalize the
distorted argument that reaches your eyes and ears. Look harder.
