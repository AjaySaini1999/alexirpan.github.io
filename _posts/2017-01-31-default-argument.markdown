title:  "The Default Position Problem"

The ideas here are all old news, but some anvils need to be dropped.

Most arguments, especially political ones, fail because both parties argue from a
default position. The logic goes roughly like this.

1. I believe X.
2. The other person believes Y.
3. X is the right belief.
4. If I can show that the other person's reasons for believing Y are wrong,
they'll believe X instead.

The first two are prerequistes to an argument. The third is a matter of debate.
The fourth is where everything goes to shit.

I feel astoundingly stupid when I put that into words, because nobody actually
believes step 4, right? And yet I have to admit I've fallen into that trap
before.

Stop me if you've heard this story before. Two people on the Internet are arguing.
One believes X, the other believes Y. The X believer comes up with a reason
someone would believe Y, then writes a scathing comment attacking it. The Y
believer does the same thing. Meanwhile, neither has addressed the actual
reason one believes X and the other believes Y.

Y supporters read all the stupid rebuttals made against X
supporters. "Wow, Y supporters think we believe X because of *that*?" X
supporters read all the stupid rebuttals made against Y supporters.
"Wow, X supporters think we believe Y because of *that*?"

Then they agree on one thing. "Why should I listen to this people? Their
reasoning is garbage, and whenever you try to show why they hurl garbage in your
face." But the real problem is that you *think* their reasoning is garbage,
and they *think* your reasoning is garbage, when neither may be true.

**Your position is not the default position. No one's is.**
Pointing out problems in other people's arguments only shows there are problems
in those arguments. It doesn't make your argument any more valid, and therefore
they don't have to replace their belief with yours. Besides, who says your
argument would stand up to the same level of scrutiny? All you've really shown
is that the people you're talking to don't have counterarguments. How do
you know no counterarguments exist? And if they do, why should people believe
you're any more right?

Okay, look. I'll be blunt. Some people do believe in things for stupid reasons.
The harm comes when you generalize the stupidity. If you're looking to challenge
your thinking, you should assume there's an intellectually consistent argument
for opposing beliefs. As the idea spreads from person to person, it gets muddled
through people's explanations, like a game of [telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers),
and by the time it got through your filter bubble it's been heavily distorted
into something weaker than it was. So don't put too much stock in the
distorted argument that reaches you. Look harder.
