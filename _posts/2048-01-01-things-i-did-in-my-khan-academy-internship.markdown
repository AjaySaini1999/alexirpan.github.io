- Met some really cool people, both interns and full-timers.
- Got to discuss Lockhart's Lament, the zone of proximal development, and
other metacognitive techniques.
- Ate some freshly baked bread with self-churned butter.
- Met a software developer who has played Hatoful Boyfriend, the pigeon
dating simulator. Pigeons forever! Okosan is best bird!
- Built an automated backup system for Khan Academy's mailing list data.
- Wrote some unit test infrastructure that made it easier to test behavior
on Khan Academy endpoints.
- Improved QoL in the code deploy process.
- Found and fixed a cron job that had been silently broken for 9 months, which
involved some of the best debugging I've ever done.
- Drank far, far too much tea. It's not my fault the office stocks unsweetened tea,
and it's also not my fault the office is in walking distance of several milk tea
places.
- Taught two interns how to play Dominion, and totally kicked their butts
while doing it.
- In return, got my butt totally kicked in Medici, Ticket to Ride, Settlers of
Catan, and Tzol'kin.
- Actually won a few games of Coup!
- ...after losing many more games of Coup.
- Also, gained a new appreciation for the Coup metagame. (I got to pretend to be
a Captain that was pretending to be an Ambassador! And I almost got away with it too.)
- Added some easter eggs, including ASCII art of an Arcanine.
- Failed to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded (but I did get it after the talent
show.)
- Did some real, honest to God machine learning for the annual Healthy Hackathon.
It involved computing similarities between columns in a sparse user-video matrix.
Yes, we were trying to be like Netflix. No, we did not replicate Netflix in a week.
Yes, it was still really cool.
- Played D&D for the first time. I shot an arrow right into somebody's face, it was
wicked. Somewhat less wickedly, a snake almost Total Party Killed us.
- Got into a discussion about cloning ethics with other interns in a Chinese restaurant,
then realized we were a real life version of the dining philosophers problem.
