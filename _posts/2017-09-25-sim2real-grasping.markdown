Today, the paper [Using Simulation and Domain Adaptation to Improve Efficiency of Deep Robotic Grasping](https://goo.gl/G1HSws) went public on arXiv. I've been working on this project for the
past 6 months, and this is the first time I've been first author on a research paper,
so overall it's a Pretty Big Deal for me. I share first authorship with Konstantinos Bousmalis
and Paul Wohlhart, both of whom were great to work with.
The link above will take you to a landing page with the arXiv link and a video that
briefly explains our work.

If it wasn't clear from the lengthy author list, a lot of people contributed to this
project. Thanks to everyone for the mentorship and the engineering support
that made this project possible.
