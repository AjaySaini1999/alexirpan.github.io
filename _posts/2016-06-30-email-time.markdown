I started work about a month ago. So far, it has involved sending lots of
emails to lots of people, as I figure out a project to work on. Asking
them what they work on, what they think about, and so forth.

Here's a paraphrase of one reply I got back.

> Sure, I can talk about what I'm doing. I'm on vacation right now, but
> if it's time sensitive we could talk on Monday. Tentatively, I'm free
> in the evenings, 8 pm your time (11 pm my time, I'm on the East Coast.)

Can you imagine how awful I felt after reading that email? I didn't know
they were on vacation. if I had, I wouldn't have emailed them, and I certainly
didn't want to keep them up for a work call at 11pm. At the same time,
it was time sensitive, and it could have helped me figure things out, and they
were proposing to meet at night not me, so...I said yes. We did a phone call,
figured out our interests didn't align as well as they could have, and that
was that.
