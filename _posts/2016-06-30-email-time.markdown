I started work about a month ago. It's been a whirlwind, and I still
don't feel settled down yet, but things are starting to fall into place.

One of my first tasks at work is to reflect on my research interests,
find other people's research interests, and figure out a meaningful
project that lies in both. That means sending lots of emails to figure
out what people are working on and what they're interested in.

Instant messaging apps like Slack may be the new kid
on the block, but email is still the lifeblood of a company's
communication. Proper email etiquette is to respect other people's time,
and avoid sending extraneous emails.

Let's say I send an email. Three days later, I haven't gotten a reply.
Any of the following could be true.

* They read the email, and don't want to reply to it.
* They read the email, and are planning to reply to it when they're less
busy.
* They read the email, and have forgotten to reply to it.
* They haven't read the email because they're on vacation.

What I should do in response depends on which of these is true. If they're
busy or on vacation, I should wait until they get to me. If they've forgotten,
I should send a reminder. If they don't want to reply, I should either send
an email convicing them it's worth replying, or stop sending emails to respect
their decision.

However, all I observe is no reply in my inbox. So, which one's true?

Information theory 101: if there
are several reasonable hypotheses that all lead to the same observation,
and you want to figure out which one is true, you are screwed.

So far, my rule of thumb is to model people as busy and working in good faith.
That means being patient with email replies, sending reminders for important
requests, and dropping email threads if I don't get a response to a polite
request.

This has worked well enough, but can we do better?

To start, here are simple things that can help with this.

* Somebody goes on vacation. They set up an auto-reply saying they're on
vacation, and will be back in a week.
* Someone's busy with work, and gets an email they want to respond to, but
it'll take a lot of time to respond properly. They send a quick reply
explaining the situation, promising to look at it more thoroughly later.

This changes the observation. Now I know you're on vacation, or busy, and
won't spam your inbox with more emails.

If you want to be treated differently depending on how busy you are,
you have to tell people how busy you are. Otherwise, you run into the
problem Philip Guo observed: several people will all make polite,
reasonable requests for your time, and if you agree to all of them
you'll be eternally busy.

Which brings me to the most insidious pair of scenarios.

* They don't want to reply to my email.
* They forgot to reply to my email.

I have almost never gotten an email verifying the first one. When people
don't want to deal with something, they ignore it. I'm guilty of this
too, based on my several unanswered LinkedIn invitations.
I think people don't want to hurt the sender's feelings, or want to have
plausible deniability.

But, if it was socially acceptable to politely tell people their emails
weren't worth replying to, I wouldn't have to worry about whether I
was being a bother to somebody or not.

I've mentioned similar ideas to some of my friends, and they don't think
the same way. I think these feelings all flow from my social awkwardness
and latent self-esteem issues. I don't want to annoy people, but I'm not
socially adept enough to notice when I'm annoying people, and no one
wants to be that guy/girl who says the harsh truth...

Or, this could all be paranoia on my part. Because, people keep in contact
with me despite all this.

I believe communication would be better if it was okay to say these harsh
truths, but there's too much going against it. Saying things like that
only works if both parties know saying
