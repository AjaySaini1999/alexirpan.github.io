CHANGE THE INTRO

I started work about a month ago. It's been a whirlwind, and I still
don't feel settled down yet, but things are starting to fall into place.

One of my first tasks at work is to think about my research interests,
check other people's research interests, and figure out a meaningful
project that lies in both. That means sending lots of emails, asking
what people are working on, what they're interested in, what they think
about, and so forth.
Instant messaging apps like Slack may be the new kid
on the block, but email is still the lifeblood of a company's
communication.

At the same time, emails shouldn't take up all of an employee's time.
They are a necessary cost to keep communication running. In the workplace,
proper email etiquette is to waste as little of the other person's time
as possible. I've had time to think about email's social norms, and
honestly, there's a lot that feels slightly broken.

Let's say I send an email. Three days later, I haven't gotten a reply
yet. Any one of the following could be true.

* They read the email, and are ignore it on purpose.
* They read the email, and are planning to reply to it later.
* They read the email, and have forgotten to reply to it.
* They haven't read the email because they're very busy with work, but
they'll catch up on email at some point.
* They haven't read the email because they're on vacation or out of office.

Proper protocol on my part depends on the scenario. In the first, I shouldn't
send another email, because they'll ignore it again and it'll waste both
of our time. In the second, I should send another email to remind them
to reply to the first one. In the third, I shouldn't send another email
because they'll get there eventually. In the fourth, I should wait until they're
back in the office.

However, all I observe is no reply in my inbox. So, which one's true?

Information theory 101: if there
are several plausible hypotheses that all lead to the same observation,
and you want to figure out which one is true, you are pretty boned.

Alright. What can people do to give email senders more information?

* If they don't want to talk to you, they can respectfully tell you they
aren't interested. Or more commonly, they phrase their email in a way
that tries to send "not interested" in the subtext, and hope you get the
hint, because they're trying to be a nice person and not hurt your feelings
outright.
* They can send a short email saying "Acknowledged, will reply soon, send
me a follow-up if I don't." Or, send an email saying "Very busy, send follow-up
if this is truly urgent."
* If they're on vacation, they can set up an auto-reply saying so.

Some people do this, but not enough. Note that I haven't done anything like
this, because it's only now that I've started viewing email as a really
helpful parasite that needs to be kept in line.




PUT THIS AT THE END

Here's a paraphrase of one reply I got back.

> Sure, I can talk about what I'm doing. I'm on vacation right now, but
> if it's time sensitive we could talk on Monday. Tentatively, I'm free
> in the evenings, 8 pm your time (11 pm my time, I'm on the East Coast.)

Can you imagine how awful I felt after reading that email? I didn't know
they were on vacation. if I had, I wouldn't have emailed them, and I certainly
didn't want to keep them up for a work call at 11pm. At the same time,
it was time sensitive, and it could have helped me figure things out, and they
were proposing to meet at night not me, so...I said yes. We did a phone call,
and it turns out our research interests didn't align as well as they could have.
So, that was that.
