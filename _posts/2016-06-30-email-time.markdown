I started work about a month ago. It's been a whirlwind, and I still
don't feel settled down yet, but things are starting to fall into place.

One of my first tasks at work is to reflect on my research interests,
find other people's research interests, and figure out a meaningful
project that lies in both. That means sending lots of emails to figure
out what people are working on and what they're interested in.

Instant messaging apps like Slack may be the new kid
on the block, but email is still the lifeblood of a company's
communication. Proper email etiquette is to respect other people's time,
and avoid sending extraneous emails.

Let's say I send an email. Three days later, I haven't gotten a reply.
Any of the following could be true.

* They read the email, and don't want to reply to it.
* They read the email, and are planning to reply to it when they're less
busy.
* They read the email, and have forgotten to reply to it.
* They haven't read the email because they're on vacation.

What I should do in response depends on which of these is true. If they're
busy or on vacation, I should wait until they get to me. If they've forgotten,
I should send a reminder. If they don't want to reply, I should either send
an email convicing them to reply, or stop sending emails to respect their
decision.

However, all I observe is no reply in my inbox. So, which one's true?

Information theory 101: if there
are several reasonable hypotheses that all lead to the same observation,
and you want to figure out which one is true, you are screwed.

So far, my rule of thumb is to model people as busy and working in good faith.
That means being patient with email replies, sending reminders for important
requests, and ignoring emails.

What happens next depends on the person. My rule of thumb is to assume good
will, because most people I deal with aren't assholes. That means generally
being patient on getting email replies, and sending small follow-ups if it's
an important request.

This works out okay, but we can do better. Here's some quick examples that
show how to streamline communication.

* Somebody goes on vacation. They set up an auto-reply saying they're on
vacation, and will be back in a week.
* Someone's busy with work, and gets an email they want to respond to, but
it'll take a lot of time to respond properly. They send a quick reply
explaining the situation, promising to look at it more thoroughly later.

When people do this, it helps me understand their situation. Because, and
this is obvious, I'm not the other guy/girl! All I have is myself. If I've
never emailed you before, I don't have any way to figure out how you handle
email.

Which brings me to the most insidious scenario.

* They read the email, and don't want to reply to it.

I have almost never gotten a reply that tells me up front that they're
not interested. For that matter, I've almost never sent such a reply
myself. The several unanswered LinkedIn invitations I have attest to this.

I claim that people ignore emails entirely because they don't want to
spend any more time than they have to, or they want to save other people's
feelings. In other hands, people ignore emails for noble reasons. I've heard
math/CS professors talk about how many emails they get from cranks claiming
to have an elementary proof of Fermat's Last Theorem or P = NP. They don't
have time to explain why they're wrong, and the moment they reply to a crank,
that crank sees it as license to harass the professor. So, they don't reply
at all.

But, to me it seems like this directly contributes to misguided drama.
Another reason people don't reply to emails is because they want to have
plausible deniability. As soon as you say it outright, it becomes common
knowledge that employee X doesn't like employee Y, or employee X doesn't think
employee Y is worth their time. As long as you don't reply, you can pretend
the email got misplaced.

And then someone doesn't reply to an email because it actually did get misplaced,
and because of the global political norms, people start assuming lots of nasty
subtext.

Stuff like this bothers me. I'm not the most socially adept person, so
maybe this is just how people think communication should work. But why can't it
work the other way?

From an organizational level, the problem is that this kind of frank communication
only works if everyone agrees they should manage email this way. If only one
person is telling people they don't want to deal with this, they'll just be
labelled as a jackass.

I've heard GiveWell has a custom emoticon, that means "I'm very busy, and don't
have time to review this fully, but it looks good at a surface level, and I
trust your judgment." And it's funny, that this is a useful enough feature to have
an entire emoticon dedicated to it, but I can see the benefits. It lets employees
request oversight, while knowing up-front that they shouldn't expect to
get feedback on everything.



PUT THIS AT THE END

Here's a paraphrase of one reply I got back.

> Sure, I can talk about what I'm doing. I'm on vacation right now, but
> if it's time sensitive we could talk on Monday. Tentatively, I'm free
> in the evenings, 8 pm your time (11 pm my time, I'm on the East Coast.)

Can you imagine how awful I felt after reading that email? I didn't know
they were on vacation. if I had, I wouldn't have emailed them, and I certainly
didn't want to keep them up for a work call at 11pm. At the same time,
it was time sensitive, and it could have helped me figure things out, and they
were proposing to meet at night not me, so...I said yes. We did a phone call,
and it turns out our research interests didn't align as well as they could have.
So, that was that.
