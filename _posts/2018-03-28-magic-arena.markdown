I've played Magic: the Gathering on and off for nearly 15 years. It's a very,
very well designed card game, with a lot of depth and complexity.

Despite liking the game a lot, I haven't played that much Magic recently,
mostly because it's pretty expensive, and it's hard to justify the cost when
so much entertainment is free or pretty cheap. So, when Wizards of the Coast
announced MTG Arena, a free-to-play online version of MTG, I signed up for the
beta. I got lucky and got an invite a few days before the closed beta went
public, and have been playing it since.

First, the good parts. This is the first digital implementation of Magic I've
ever played, and so far I have very few issues with it. There are animations,
but they don't get in the way, and I've yet to hit a bug in the interface that
doesn't let me make the play I want to make. I have run into a few issues with
the auto-tap - in one game, I was playing a UB control deck, and played a
finisher with Cancel as protection. I didn't realize auto-tap didn't leave 1UU
open, even though my lands supported doing so, and I lost because of it.
I've also found that when lots of triggers happen at once, it takes a while to
resolve them.

The experience in the first few days has been pretty magical. Everyone's account
got wiped, so everyone's starting from scratch. Real money purchases aren't
supported yet, making it impossible for people to pay-to-win their way to a
strong deck. The end result is kind-of like a massive, worldwide Sealed league.
For the unfamiliar, in a Sealed league, each player starts with 6 booster packs.
They build a deck out of the cards opened, and every 1-2 weeks, each player gets
to add an extra booster to their card pool. The same thing is happening in Arena
right now - everyone started with the same collection, and the slow unlock rate
means people rarely have more than a few slam-dunk cards.

However, that slow unlock rate is the biggest problem right now. There's been a
lot of feedback about this, so I'll keep it brief.

Right now, MTG Arena uses the following system.

* Booster packs can be bought with gold and give you new cards. Sometimes, packs
will contain wildcards, which be redeemed for an arbitrary card of that rarity.
An uncommon wildcard can be spent to create a copy of any uncommon card.
* Unlike Hearthstone, there is no crafting system. Hearthstone has a dust system,
where cards can be disenchanted into dust and dust can be crafted into cards.
Instead, MTG Arena has "the Vault". The Vault charges up whenever you open a
booster and whenever you open extra copies of a card. When it fully charges,
you can open the Vault to get some rewards.
