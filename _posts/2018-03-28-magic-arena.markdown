I've played Magic: the Gathering on and off for nearly 15 years. It's a
great card game, with tons of depth. It's only downside is that it can get
pretty expensive. So when I heard
Wizards of the Coast was working on a free-to-play version called MTG Arena, I
signed up for the beta. I was lucky enough to get an invite, and the beta's
recently went out of NDA, so I figured I'd give some first impressions.

This is the first digital implementation of Magic I've
ever played. So far, the implementation feels smooth.
The animations add a bit without getting in the way, and rules-wise I've yet
to hit any problems. I have run into issues with the auto-tap though. In one game,
I was playing a UB control deck, and played one of my finishers with Cancel
backup. I didn't realize the auto-tap had tapped all my Islands until my
opponents turn, and it made me lose. But I chalk that up to unfamiliarity
with the interface. It was a one-off mistake and I haven't lost like that since.

At times, I've also found it annoying to clear the stack
when a lot of triggers happen at once, but I'm willing to accept that as a
consequence of Magic's rules engine. It doesn't "pop" as much as Hearthstone
does, but the core gameplay is a lot more interesting to me, and that's what's
bringing me back.

The experience in the first few days after the NDA drop was pretty magical.
Everyone's account got wiped, and you can't spend real money yet.
Not only was everyone on a level playing
field, no one could pay-to-win their way to a strong deck.
The end result was like a massive, worldwide Sealed league. For the
uninitiated, Sealed is a Magic format where every player gets 6 booster packs
and builds a deck out of those cards.
A Sealed league is a Sealed tournament that runs over several weeks.
Every 1-2 weeks, players add an extra booster pack to their card pool.

Arena is essentially in a similar state, thanks to the slow unlock rate.
And therein lies the problem. Most people have terrible decks, because it's
currently very difficult to build good ones, even if you spend a lot of time
playing the game.

Now, I was planning on writing a post complaining about the economy,
but then [a really good post that covered everything I wanted to cover](https://rngeternal.com/2018/03/28/going-deep-analyzing-the-mtga-economy/).
Instead of repeating the same points, I'll share some realizations I had.

I have a lot more respect for Hearthstone's core economy. I don't like
where Hearthstone's gameplay has gone, but the core dusting and crafting
mechanics are well designed. 30 card decks with at most 2 copies of a card
makes it easier to build a collection. The 3rd copy of every card can be
disenchanted for free, and the 1st and 2nd copy can be disenchanted too if you
don't think that card will be useful in the future.
In MTG Arena, I have to open 4 copies of a common before I can make progress
towards the Vault, which is Arena's equivalent of disenchanting.

The developers of MTG Arena said they decided against a disenchant system
because it created feel-bad moments when people disenchanted cards they needed
later. That's true, but in its place they've created feel-bad
moments when players open cards they don't want, with little choice on how
to turn them into cards they do want. I own several commons where I have 3 unplayed
copies of the same card, and I can't do anything with them.

At a broader level, I've started appreciating the fragility of things.
The best part of my MTG Arena experience was at the beginning, when everything was new,
people were still figuring out the meta, and draft chaff decks were competitive.
Nothing about that environment was going to last, but I didn't expect it to.
In many ways it reminds me of the early years of the brony fandom. A ton of
ridiculous stuff happened, and no one knew where the fandom was going, but just
being on the ride was exciting. The first BronyCon must have been insane, because
I doubt there was a good understanding for what a brony convention should do.

The fandom has cooled down since then. Content creators settled in. Conventions
have turned into institutions. Season 3 disappointed a lot of fans. The fandom's
still going - Season 8 premiered last week - but it's condensed into something
that's lost a lot of its initial magic.

The question is whether people should have expected the fandom to keep its magic
forever. On reflection, I don't think ponies were ever going to stay as
culturually relevant as they were in 2012. And there's nothing wrong with that.
Fads come and go. But if you calibrated your definition of "fandom" to the peak
of that fandom's relevance, then everything afterwards is going to be a
disappointment. I saw a Reddit post asking if research in deep learning was
slowing down. I don't think it is, but I do feel there have been fewer
fundamental architecture shifts. There were a few years where every
state-of-the-art ImageNet model introduced something new, and if you were watching
the field at that time, the field would have looked ridiculously open. It's a lot less
ridiculous now.

This is a personal thing, but I'm not a big fandom jumper. I tend to get into a
few fandoms, and then stick with them for a long, long time. And for a while,
I looked down on people who kept jumping fandoms. It felt like they were just
chasing the new high, the new thing. I didn't seem them as "true fans", I saw
them as people who liked the collective enthusiasm of new things, and as soon
as it stopped they had to jump to the next new thing to get their fix.
I don't look down on this anymore. If that's what people are looking for, who
am I to judge?

it's just that if you do decide to stick with something, and it starts getting
worse, I don't think it's productive to complain about "the good old days."
It's okay to analyze it, or try to fix it, or even explain why you're leaving,
but I suspect that many communities start because of forces outside of their
control. People get pulled in, and then something eventually breaks down.
People who don't like this blame the community for "ruining something", or
"destroying the fandom", instead of blaming
the disappearance of the outside forces that made the community grow in the
first place.

The thing that gets you into a community doesn't have to be the thing that
gets you to stay. There's even a [TVTropes page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/ComeForTheXStayForTheY)
for this. If the community has moved to a point that you don't want to stay at,
and if it doesn't seem like you can change it, then perhaps you should just
leave, and cherish the good times you had.
