I've played Magic: the Gathering on and off for nearly 15 years. It's a
very well designed card game, with tons of depth. So when I heard
Wizards of the Coast was working on a free-to-play version called MTG Arena, I
signed up for the beta. I was lucky enough to get an invite, and the beta's
recently went out of NDA, so I figured I'd give some first impressions.

This is the first digital implementation of Magic I've
ever played. So far, I like it.
The animations add a bit without getting in the way, and rules-wise I've yet
to hit any problems. I have run into issues with the auto-tap. In one game,
I was playing a UB control deck, and played one of my finishers with Cancel
backup. I didn't realize the auto-tap had tapped all my Islands until my
opponents turn, and it made me lose. After paying closer attention, I haven't
lost like that since. At times, I've also found it annoying to clear the stack
when a lot of triggers happen at once, but I'm willing to accept that as a
consequence of Magic's rules engine. It doesn't "pop" as much as Hearthstone
does, but the core gameplay is a lot more interesting to me, and that's what's
bringing me back.

The experience in the first few days after the NDA drop was pretty magical.
Everyone's account got wiped, and real money purchases aren't
supported yet. This not only meant that everyone started at a level playing
field, it also meant that no one could pay-to-win their way to a strong deck.
The end result was like a massive, worldwide Sealed league. For the
unfamiliar, in Sealed, each player gets 6 booster packs and needs to build a
deck out of those packs. A Sealed league is a Sealed tournament that runs over
a few weeks, and every 1-2 weeks, players get to open an extra booster pack.
Arena was essentially in a similar state, and it's still in that state right
now, thanks to the slow unlock rate.

And therein lies the problem - it's currently very difficult to build good
decks. Now, I was planning on writing a post complaining about the economy,
but then [a really good post that covered everything I wanted to cover](https://rngeternal.com/2018/03/28/going-deep-analyzing-the-mtga-economy/).
Instead of rehashing the same point, I'll share some realizations I had.

One, I have a lot more respect for Hearthstone's core economy. I don't like
where the game has gone, but the core dusting and crafting mechanics make a lot
of sense. Limiting decks to at most 2 copies of card means the 3rd copy and up
can be converted into dust without worry.
In MTG Arena, I have to open 4 copies of a common before I can start making
progress towards the cards I want. Granted, this is just a matter of tweaking
the numbers. If the rate of unlock was higher, I wouldn't be bothered at all.
Right now, I get annoyed when I see I have 3 of a common that I'd never play,
because I know that's all dead weight.

The lack of a disenchant or card conversion system hurts a lot. The developers
said they removed a disenchant system to avoid feel-bad moments where people
disenchanted cards they needed later, but in its place they've created feel-bad
moments when players open cards they don't want, with nothing they can do about
it.

Second, it's made me appreciate the fragility of things more. The best part of
my MTG Arena experience was the moment at the start, when everything was new,
people were still figuring out the meta, and draft chaff decks were competitive.
Nothing about that was going to last, and I didn't expect it to, but it was
fun to milk the environment while it lasted. In many ways it reminds me of the
early years of the brony fandom, where a ton of ridiculous stuff happened, and
no one knew where the fandom was going, but just being on the ride was exciting.
After a more mediocre Season 3, and the settling-in of existing content creators,
the fandom started cooling down, condensing into something less exciting that
was missing a lot of its initial magic.

There's nothing wrong with this. Fads come and go. But if you're calibrated
to just the peak of something's relevance, everything aftewards is going
to be disappointing. Bitcoin's price has dropped from its record high, but
I'm not sure it was supposed to follow its rapid growth forever. I saw a Reddit
post asking if research in deep learning was slowing down. I don't think it is,
but I feel there have been fewer fundamental architecture shifts in recent years,
and perhaps that's just because we've snagged all the low-hanging fruit.

This is a personal thing, but I'm not a big fandom jumper. I tend to get into a
few fandoms and then stick with them for a long, long time. Part of me thinks
that people are just chasing the new high, the new thing, and when it stops being
the new thing, they have to find the next new thing to get their fix of
collective enthusiasm. I used to look down on this. I don't anymore, because I
get it now. Some things genuinely are that fleeting.

It's just that if you do decide to stick with something, and it starts getting
worse, I don't think it's productive or useful to complain about it too much.
The thing that gets you into a community doesn't have to be the thing that
gets you to stay. If you can't find a reason to stay, then maybe you should
just leave.
