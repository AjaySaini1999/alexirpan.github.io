I realize it's a while after Mystery Hunt, but now that
[My Little Pony: Puzzles Are Magic](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/) has
wrapped up, I have time to finish my post about Mystery Hunt 2020.
(I may have some more personal posts about Puzzles are Magic after this, but
no promises.)

I got to Boston on Wednesday night, spending Thursday working remotely. As I
said in Part 1, I hunted with teammate this year, and we spent the day before
hunt socializing and figuring out logistics. I ended up acquiring a bunch of
power strips the day before Hunt, with no room in my carry-on to bring them
back, so all those power strips got donated to other team members by
the end of Hunt.

Before Hunt start, we read through the rules and learned answer checking would
be automated this year. As has been said many times elsewhere, teammate tends
to be very aggressive on answer guesses. Speaking personally (and definitely
not for others on the team), here's why I tend
to send a lot guesses during Hunt.

To me, good puzzle solvers are distinguished
by their ability to correctly generalize from limited data, solve around
mistakes they've made in data collection, and rapidly form and discard hypotheses
about how a puzzle works. More concretely, if you can reliably solve puzzles
from 80% of the clues, it takes 80% of the time per puzzle. Except, in practice,
it works out to *faster* than 80%, because the last 20% of clues are the hardest
ones.
The same principle holds for metapuzzles. If you can solve a
meta from 60% of the feeders, then you get to skip the hardest 40% of that round,
which often works out to less than half the time of a full 100% forward solve.

Because of this, if you're interested in getting faster at hunts, you want to
shortcut everything you believe you can shortcut, and that includes making low
confidence guesses that rely on a few your assumptions being true. The answer
checker acts as a binary signal of "all your generalizations were right", or
"at least one of your generalizations was wrong", and although it's a very
low-bandwidth signal, it's something that's there. So if the hunt lets you
be more aggressive on guesses, I'll naturally use it a bit more.
It's not
personal towards the puzzle author - their puzzle is one of many puzzles
within the cohesive whole that makes up Mystery Hunt.

Sorry, that went on longer than I thought. On to specific puzzle stories.

I looked around a few puzzles at the beginning, but the one I started first
was Goldilocks. I filled in a few clues, someone else figured out the
mechanic, then I failed to get any more clues and spent my time setting
up indexing in the spreadsheet instead.

The next one I worked on was The Trebuchet, and here it was a similar story.
By the time I got to the puzzle, they had Boggled a few words (the voice
actors from Bolt), and after we realized the ammunition were all puns,
the rest of the walls fell pretty fast. I IDed a few of the shows for
BLOCK OF TNT (wtf SHAQ LIFE is a show??), then started moving letters to
the final wall as we got them. We expected them to slot in automatically,
instead of acting like a drop quote, but I noted we were a few swaps away
from (PHRASE) and someone else finished it from there.

With that puzzle done, I jumped back to Storybook Forest, looking at
Toddler Tilt. I did some work on it, but had trouble getting the toddlers
to fall in the right order, and as we struggled through it, I noticed I
was going through it slower than other people, and decided my time would be
better spent on the meta.

Looking through the Storybook Forest meta, I saw there were some tic-tac-toe
theories. We had a lot of 9 letter answers, and the puzzles were arranged in
a 3 x 3 grid. I decided to try extracting the same way as the Dolphin meta
from 20,000 Puzzles Under the Sea, which actually sort of worked, but there
were some weird answers that extracted 2 letters, and there weren't great
ways to use the 11 letter answers. I started looking up tic-tac-toe variants
that might have 11 spots to play, and in the middle of doing so the meta was
solved by someone who didn't believe in any of our tic-tac-toe work.

With that finished, I decided to look back towards The Grand Castle meta.
We had 4 answers in that round, and after some false starts based on
"stately" and "capital", someone discovered the Texas panhandle. I immediately
noted that the panhandle had 26 counties, but out of the final answer of OILMEN,
we had letters LMNO, and that made us think we had an ordering instead.
Writing out the second word of each answer in the panhandle grid gave this.

On seeing this, I proposed that the 2nd words were going to form a cryptic
ending in enumeration SIX. Someone else argued the cryptic would involve
anagramming RACHEL and a possible continuation would be CHARLEMAGNE or
CHARLES, so we called it in, and it was wrong.
We tried a few more variants, but none of those worked either.

We looked at it a bit more, and a 5th feeder answer came in, slotting in
here.

After seeing this, I proposed that we'd actually get *two* cryptics, that
would both share enumeration SIX, and our answer should be a 12-letter
answers. I tried CHARLEMAGNES, plural, and that was wrong. Then someone
found Six Flags Over Texas, which provided an ordering on the clues, and
now that we didn't just have letters LMNO, I was okay with trying the
A-Z idea again, and we solved it.

With those rounds done, it was time to look at Spaceopolis. I watched
our teammates sing karoake, and someone else got the Masked Singer a-ha,
so I decided to do data entry and indexing. The extraction looked bad,
and someone walked around asking for volunteers to solve The Magic
Railway konundrum we'd just unlock. I agreed, played a mean house elf master
for about an hour, and after finding the solution GRACE UNDER FIRE
