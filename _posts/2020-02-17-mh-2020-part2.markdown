Now that
[My Little Pony: Puzzles Are Magic](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/) has
wrapped up, I have time to finish my posts about MIT Mystery Hunt 2020. And
only well over a month after Hunt too!

This post is *long*. I decided to bundle all my remaining thoughts about Hunt
into one post, to motivate me to finish it before too much time had passed,
and this post is the result.


Before Hunt
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before MIT Mystery Hunt officially starts, people on our team like trying to
identify hidden Mystery Hunt data before the hunt officially starts. This year,
we had two targets: the emails from Left Out, and the wedding invitations.

Every email we got from Left Out had a different signature. There was "Like Pluto,
Left Out". Another said "Like J in a Playfair Cipher, Left Out". Then there was
"Like a cake in the rain, Left Out". Some people felt this was just Left Out's
gimmick (every signature is about something that's left out), but *maybe*
they were a puzzle, so we kept track of all of them.

When we got all the emails about the overnight situation, I argued this was
weak evidence in favor of the emails being a puzzle. The argument went like this:
if the emails were a puzzle, Left Out would need to know exactly how many
different signatures they needed to send before Hunt. The overnight situation
was a surprise. Therefore, if the emails were a puzzle, they wouldn't have
custom signatures prepared for those emails, and none of the overnight situation
emails had a custom signature.

Someone else pointed out that given the seriousness of the situation, Left Out
wasn't likely to include a jokey signature in those emails, whether or not the
emails were a puzzle. That convinced me the emails weren't a puzzle.

The wedding invitations, on the other hand...

![Wedding invite with lines](/public/mh20-part2/hunt_invite.png)
{: .centered }

We recognized the first invite was a reference to the 2011 MIT Mystery Hunt
invitation, but the second invite looked weirder. Why did the alignment look
a little off center? Why was WED LOVE YOU TO JOIN US! missing an apostrophe in
WE'D? Was it just "WED" for "WEDDING", or was it something more? And so on.

Last year, our "is this a puzzle" theories were all in a channel named `#innovated-shitposting`
(later renamed `#ambiguous-shitposting`).
This year, it was `#wed-love-u-2-shitpost`. The working theory was that "join us"
meant "draw connecting lines", "to" meant "connect the 2s", "love" meant
"connect the hearts in 12:00 EST", and "you" mean "connect the letter Us".

So, uh, yeah, that's where all those red lines come from. We also thought it
might have involved folding, so we tried that too.

![Folded invite](/public/mh20-part2/hunt_invite_folded.png)
{: .centered }

As I was boarding my flight to Boston, my position was that the invite was
more-likely-than-not a puzzle (say, 60% chance), but it would come with a shell
that we wouldn't see until Hunt, so until then I wasn't going to try anything.

Meanwhile, two teammates on teammate had a $20 bet on whether the email signatures
were a puzzle. One was adamant they were, the other was adamant they weren't.
They agreed to a bet, and to quote the loser,
"I'm a lot less confident in my bet now that I've read all the emails."

The day before hunt was spent socializing, figuring out who would get
power strips (me), and figuring out our
[Mystery Hunt Bingo](https://www.alexirpan.com/mystery-hunt-bingo/) for the year.
One teammate refreshed until they
got a board that would give a bingo if it had puzzles we wanted to see. ("I like
this board, because we'll get a bingo if there's a puzzle about video games and
a puzzle about anime.")
But, was cherry-picking a bingo board ethical?
We discussed it at the social, and Rahul proclaimed "It's *okay* to cheat at bingo".
Cherry-picked bingo it is.

We did get the bingo line that used video games and anime, although it was a
close call. We needed an anime that came out in the past 2 years, and
Wanted: Gangs of Six came through with
[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure:_Golden_Wind).


A Tangent About Guessing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the minutes before Hunt, we learned there would be an automatic checker
this year. That's as blunt a segue as any to talk about guess rates.

As has been said many times elsewhere, teammate is an outlier on submitting
tons of guesses during Mystery Hunt.
Speaking personally (and definitely not for others on the team),
here's why I tend to guess a lot during Hunt.

To me, good puzzle solvers are distinguished
by their ability to correctly generalize from limited data, solve around
mistakes they've made in data collection, and rapidly form and discard hypotheses
about how a puzzle works. More concretely, if you can reliably solve puzzles
from 80% of the clues, it takes 80% of the time per puzzle. Except, in practice,
it works out to *faster* than 80%, because the last 20% of clues are the hardest
ones.
The same principle holds for metapuzzles. If you can solve a
meta from 60% of the feeders, then you get to skip the hardest 40% of that round,
so you may cut your solve time by over half of what you'd spend in a full
100% forward solve.

Because of this, if you want to solve hunts faster, you should
shortcut as much as you can, and that includes making low
confidence guesses that rely on a few of your assumptions being true. The answer
checker is a binary signal between "all your generalizations were correct", or
"at least one of your generalizations was wrong", and although it's a very
low-bandwidth signal, it's a signal that's there. So if the hunt lets you
be more aggressive on guesses, I'll naturally submit a lot of aspirational
guesses.
It's not
personal towards the puzzle author - their puzzle is one of many puzzles
within the cohesive whole that makes up MIT Mystery Hunt. I'm not going to
abuse [OneLook](https://onelook.com/) to solve a cryptic crossword by itself,
but I may abuse OneLook to solve a cryptic crossword that's part of a larger
hunt, once I've gotten through all the clues that look fun.

Did this pay off? Here's a chart of puzzles solved versus guess accuracy of
that team.

![Solves vs acc all teams](/public/mh20-part2/solves_by_acc_all.png)
{: .centered }

The trendline of this chart definitely suggests that teams with lower guess
accuracy solved more puzzles. But hang on a second: there are bunch of
teams with 100% success rate that only solved a few puzzles. Here's the
same plot, if we remove all teams that solved fewer than 10 puzzles.

![Solves vs acc 10 or more](/public/mh20-part2/solves_by_acc_10ormore.png)
{: .centered }

Now, the downward trendline is gone.

My feeling is that yes, teams that guess more did do better this Hunt. However,
the size of that effect is small, and solving speed is still dominated
by general solver ability, and random luck in how fast a team figures out
the metapuzzles.

One other tangent is that I feel a lot of the Puzzlvaria discussion about
guessing is around metapuzzles that were backsolve friendly, and I'm worried
people will think high guess rates come mostly from backsolves. This
isn't true - crazy guesses come from both forward solves and backward solves.

During Puzzles are Magic,
I got curious about forward solve vs backsolve rates. I went through the guess
log, made a list of all answer guesses that looked like backsolves,
and computed forward guesses vs backward guesses for each puzzle.

The results are linked on the full stats page, [here](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/hunt_stats/).
Excluding meta puzzles and endgame puzzles (puzzles that couldn't be backsolved),
across the entire hunt there were 4.38 guesses per forward solve, and
5.36 guesses per backward solve.
So yes, backsolves did have more guesses on average that hunt, but it wasn't by
a big margin.


Puzzle Stories
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

These stories are roughly told in chronological order, but I've grouped
puzzles I worked on by round. During the Hunt itself, I jumped between
rounds much more than mentioned here, so some stories may be slightly out
of order.

## Grand Castle and Storybook Forest

I looked around a few puzzles at the beginning, but the one I started first
was [Goldilocks](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/goldilocks/). I filled in a few
clues, then moved to setting up indexing when I failed to get any more clues.

The next one I worked on was [The Trebuchet](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/trebuchet/),
and here it was a similar story.
By the time I got to the puzzle, they had Boggled a few words (the voice
actors from Bolt), and after we realized the ammunition were all puns,
the rest of the walls fell pretty fast. I IDed a few more words
(wtf SHAQ LIFE is a show??), then constructed the final wall. We expected
the blocks to fall into place automatically, instead of acting like a dropquote.
I noted we were a few swaps from GEORGE BAILEY, and someone solved it from
FOE OF GEORGE BAILEY.

With that puzzle done, I jumped back to Storybook Forest. I got excited by
[Hacking' the Beanstalk](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/hackin_the_beanstalk/),
immediately recognizing the tortoise-and-hare algorithm when typing random letters.
I opened the sheet for it...and every single algorithm had already been IDed.
Our team has too many CS majors. We had the ordering, and were a bit stuck on
extraction, until someone threw a regex at it and saw [SOURCE FILES](https://nutrimatic.org/?q=%5Bdijkstra%5D%5Bpollard%5D%5Bchudnovsky%5D%5Btarjan%5D%5Beuclid%5D%5Bkadane%5D%5Bfloyd%5D%5Bviterbi%5D%5Bluhn%5D%5Bbresenham%5D%5Bgaleshapley%5D&go=Go) was the first option. It was right.

I looked at [Toddler Tilt](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/toddler_tilt/), which
no one had touched yet. However, I had trouble getting the toddlers to tilt
in the right order. I noticed the people who joined me were getting it much
faster than I was, and I decided my time would be better spent on the meta.

For the [Storybook Forest meta](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/storybook_pals/),
we had some tic-tac-toe theories.
We had a lot of 9 letter answers, and the puzzle art was arranged in a 3 x 3
grid.

![Storybook Forest art](/public/mh20-part2/storybook.png)
{: centered }

(9 puzzles, 3 x 3 grid, three animals in a row for the meta in the center. It must mean something!)
{: .centered }

I tried extracting the same way the [Dolphin meta](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2015/puzzle/pod_of_dolphins_meta/solution/) worked from MIT Mystery Hunt 2015. This sort of worked, but
some answers extracted 2 letters instead of one, and there weren't great ways to
use the 11 letter answers. I started looking for tic-tac-toe variants that might
use 11 in an interesting way, and in the middle of doing so, someone who didn't
believe any of our tic-tac-toe work solved the meta.

With that finished, I went back towards [The Grand Castle meta](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/castle/).
We had 4 answers in that round, and after some false starts based on
"stately" and "capital", someone discovered the Texas panhandle. I immediately
noted that the panhandle had 26 counties, but out of the final answer of OILMEN,
A-to-Z conversion of our answers gave LMNO, which made us think it was an
ordering. Each answer in this round was a two word phrase, and reading the
word that wasn't the county gave "MISTER RACHEL UNCERTAIN SIX". I proposed that
the 2nd words were going to form a cryptic whose answer was six letters.
Someone noticed that "Rachel uncertain" might mean anagram, giving CHARLE,
which completed to a famous ruler, CHARLEMAGNE. That sounded great! We tried
it, and it was wrong.

The next feeder we solved was the E from OILMEN, and the second letters gave
this grid.

<p class="centered">
<table border="1">
    <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>CRISPIN</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>MISTER</td>
    <td>RACHEL</td>
    <td>UNCERTAIN</td>
    <td>SIX</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</p>

Ah, so clearly, we were going to fill in the box between CRISPIN and SIX, get
two cryptics that shared SIX for the enumeration, and we'd combine them to get
a 12 letter answer! We tried CHARLEMAGNES (plural), and that was wrong too.
Someone found Six Flags Over Texas, which provided an ordering on the clues,
and now that we had an ordering, A-Z letters looked much better, and we solved
it.

## Spaceopolis, Wizard's Hollow, Balloon Vendor

With those rounds done, it was time to look at Spaceopolis. I watched
our teammates sing [karoake](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/space_karaoke/).
I did data entry and indexing for the Masked Singer a-ha, but the extraction
looked bad. While puzzling over the sheet, someone walked by and asked for
volunteers to solve [Magic Railway](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/magic_railway/),
the konundrum we had just unlocked.
Two of us agreed. I played a mean
house elf master for about an hour, briefly tried chemical elements instead
of classical elements, and we got the answer, GRACE UNDER FIRE.
Checking the status sheet, we saw Karoake had been solved, and the two of
us who left checked to see what we had missed.
It turned out we had extracted the right letters, and just failed to read
it right.

We unlocked [TEAMWORK TIME: Hat Venn-dor](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/hat_venn_dor/),
and joined the effort for that. In general, I really liked the TEAMWORK
TIME puzzles, except for the ones where you only wanted 3 or 4 people interacting
with the puzzle at once. But Hat Venn-dor was well-suited to lots of manic
guessing, and I liked that. After that, some of us had a good laugh at
[No Clue Crossword](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/no_clue_crossword/),
but we didn't get it and had to backsolve the puzzle.
We thought it might have been words that appeared in a crossword clue lookup
when you
[entered "No clue"](https://www.wordplays.com/crossword-solver/no-clue)
as the clue, but that didn't seem very good.
I forget exactly when we got the Balloon Vendor meta, but it was cute.

## YesterdayLand

The next puzzle I did major work on was [Food Court](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/food_court/). The main
thing this puzzle taught me was that I was horribly out of practice on
probability. Back in undergrad, I definitely would have solved all of the
math questions without issue. After solving one of the problems, I saw we had
answers for most questions, so I strated transcribing the probabilities into
code to compute the steady state of the Markov chain. Another teammate had
found an online tool for this, but said "it's garbage, it's only accurate
to the hundredths place". That actually was good enough for the puzzle,
but due to incorrect data, we weren't getting the right steady states.
Given how the puzzle worked, it seemed clear we needed to check our work.
I loudly went around asking people to help us do math, and was told three
times that someone was on it.
wasn't really listening (my mistake), and on the third time, they sat me
down and explained that

1. They knew someone who made Nationals of MATHCOUNTS.
2. They weren't doing Hunt, so it was okay to ask them for help.
3. They solved probability problems in their spare time for fun.
4. They were very fast and very accurate.

About 30 minutes later, they got back to us, saying "three of your answers are
wrong, they should be this."
We fixed them, reran the Markov chains, and saw the steady states
were all exact hundredths from $$0.01$$ to $$0.26$$, with small errors purely
coming from floating-point approximation. So, that was that.


A Digression on All-or-Nothing Extraction Mechanisms
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

One big lesson I learned from making Puzzles are Magic was that you always
want to check how robust your puzzle design is to errors.
Solvers
will always, always make errors in solving, even if your clues are 100%
unambiguous. So, if possible, you want to make your puzzle robust to a few
errors. For example, crosswords check each letter twice (once with the Across
clue, and once with the Down clue.)

The less robust your puzzle is, the more likely it is that solvers will do
90% of the work for a puzzle without finishing, and that feels bad. Things
that make a puzzle less robust are partial cluephrases using uncommon letters,
and all-or-nothing extraction mechanisms, where a single error cascades into
getting complete junk, even with the correct extraction mechanism.

Food Court had one of these all-or-nothing extraction mechanisms, becauses
changes to any transition probability *must* influence state probabilities
everywhere else. Otherwise, [Markov chain theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Steady-state_analysis_and_limiting_distributions) says it *literally* can't have a unique steady state.
I don't like mechanisms like this in a vacuum,
but not every puzzle can be made robust without compromising
its idea.
The core idea of "you solve
a bunch of math problems that seed a Markov chain" is compelling. So, in short,
I liked this puzzle, and I think you just have to accept the all-or-nothing
extraction is a consequence of the design and move on.


Back to YesterdayLand
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now we come to [Change Machine](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/change_machine/).
Oh boy.

I moved to this puzzle because
I was told there was a lot of mindless drudgery that needed to be done
to the spreadsheet, and I was too tired to do any real solving. The puzzle
was all about the [Omnibus](https://www.omnibusproject.com/) podcast, and
everything was IDed, but they had been IDed independently. Now that the Omnibus
connection had been found, they wanted help merging all the data by Omnibus
episode.

I was still confused, and at some point I said "Okay,
it's 3 AM and I'm very tired. I need you to give me idiot-proof instructions
for what you want me to do." Which they did, so props. After everything was
ordered, I suggested indexing the KJ number into the Bible verse (treating
KJ as short for King James, instead of Ken Jennings).
Reading in episode order gave
AD AMUSEMENT COMPANY IS KEY.

We were confused. During this process, one person had been reading
the Ken Jennings subreddit, and discovered a Reddit post where someone
asked what the hell was up with the [RIDE ENHANCERS COLLECTIVE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurelings/comments/eq3g0v/ride_enhancers_collective/)?

We had a mini mental breakdown. Was this seeded information from Left Out?
Did AD COMPANY mean Reddit? Was this actually how we were supposed to solve
the puzzle?
I dug into the post history of the [Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/user/mr_chan/), to see if they
posted on other puzzle subreddits, but all I found were posts on r/ottawa
and r/Curling, dating back several months.
Applying the left-over offset numbers to RIDE ENHHANCERS COLLECTIVE was giving
good letters, and that gave the final answer. At which point we had a much
*bigger* mental breakdown. After a bunch of
"WHAT DID WE JUST DO AND WHY DID IT WORK", we figured out that RIDE ENHANCERS COLLECTIVE was
mentioned in an ad from the Omnibus
episode that came out the weekend of Mystery Hunt, and we must have skipped
a bunch of steps.
Reading the
solution, there were three cluephrases, and we only got the last one.
So thank you, Omnibus fans. Your confusion about the RIDE ENHANCERS COLLECTIVE
was not in vain, and your Reddit post provided just enough search engine
signal for us to shortcut the puzzle.

## Big Top Carnival

With that done, I looked at the new [Big Top Carnival](https://pennypark.fun/land/bigtop/) puzzles. I didn't
do much, until someone said, "Hey, so all our answers are
Kentucky Derby horses". We piled onto the meta and got to \*I\*R\*D\*R\*, which
we guessed was "something RIDER". Noticing that horse names had mostly unique
enumerations, we asked if anyone was working on a puzzle in Big Top
with known answer length.
The group working on [Weakest Carouselink](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/weakest_carouselink/) said they had (4 4).
Finding PINK STAR as a horse option, someone proposed PINK SLIP.
The Weakest
Carouselink solvers said "that seems bad", and I pointed out it was thematic to
Weakest Link (you get fired), so we called it in and it was right. That gave
us \*S\*I\*R\*D\*R\*, and within 30 seconds we went from that to
"STIRRUP?" to "STIRRUP DRAMA!" to "AHHHHHH WE SOLVED A META WITH 5 OUT OF 12 ANSWERS".

The really good backsolvers were all asleep, but we had 7 puzzles to backsolve,
of course those of us awake were going to try. We got 3 in the next hour,
got stuck on the rest, and left the backsolves for others to finish up as we
went back to the YesterdayLand meta.

## YesterdayLand Meta

Sometime earlier that night, I had transcribed the blanks, their arrangement, and the
colors into the meta spreadsheet, and made guesses about how I wanted the
puzzle to work. After someone got the modernized answer break-in, I explained
how I felt it should work, and we started filling in letters. I had DUBSTEP for
modernized disco, which was okay. Then we tried EDM MUSIC, which was worse.
Then someone noticed that we could do ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC which freed up
the 7-long spot for PORNHUB, and after a brief "oh no they went there", we
got to the READ UNDER COLOR NUMBERS cluephrase. We didn't have enough answers
to get the meta, but I was getting pretty tired and decided to head back for
the night.

## Saturday's Safari Adventure

After I woke up, I caught up on what had happened.

* The remaining Big Top Carnival puzzles had been backsolved.
* YesterdayLand's meta was solved.
* We figured out all answers in Creative Picture Studios were emoji.
* We had unlocked Safari Adventure.

I ended up contributing the most to Safari Adventure, which is to be
expected - it was a really big round. For regular puzzles, I worked
on Golden Wolf (figured out the Gashly kids a-ha), Lion (finishing one of
the final logic puzzles), and Sheep (looking up Mega Man characters,
pointing out all the last words were 11 letters long, and spending an
hour *not* indexing by game number until someone else tried it and solved
the puzzle.) I also worked on Snake, where we got IAMB from *A*B, guessed
TROCHEES just in case, then got PACES from PACESA (we had some errors that
we guessed through).

I didn't work on Hyena, but there is a fun story for it. At one point,
the group working on it was convinced an answer was the letters in CAM,
permuted in some order, but they weren't sure what. They decided that, well
there were only 6 permutations, so they tried all 6 and got it. They then
got the letters SRT, in some order, and tried 4 of the 6 permutations,
before stopping out of fear of answer locks. During the Hunt, we thought
the answer locks were round-wide, and they didn't want to lock out other
Safari puzzles. When we backsolved it later, they were upset to learn it
was one of the 2 permutations of SRT they hadn't tried.

In the middle of Safari Adventure, we unlocked First You Visit..., which
was really funny, because there was a cascade of groans across each room
as people discovered the puzzle. Out of Puzzle Traumatic Stress Disorder,
no one solved the puzzle and we ended up backsvoling it.

For Safari metas, I looked at a few. In The Cubs
Scout, my incredibly-minor baseball knowledge helped a bit. In Zeus, I
looked up the animals, but didn't get much further. In Sam, I figured
out the stars-and-stripes idea, but didn't get the every-other trick.
We initially thought the Tiger would be a regular puzzle that was part of
5 metas, which we would have to backsolve entirely. Once we got to a 6th meta
that needed Tiger, we figured out that it was probably the metameta. The
Safari metas were getting solved pretty fast, and not every meta solver
noted what backsolve answer was left over, so a few of us decided to make
a Tiger tracking spreadsheet, to figure out what Tiger answers we had,
what we wanted to backsolve, and how each Safari meta worked. When
the Safari Adventure metameta unlocked, we transferred our data into that
sheet, and while doing so someone got the Tyger Tyger a-ha, which just
left finishing enough Safari metas to extract.

## PennyPass Postmortem

I haven't talked about the PennyPass system yet.
In this Hunt, we would
occasionally get PennyPasses, which could be used to unlock a puzzle in
any round you had unlocked.
I thought this was a neat choose-your-own-unlock-adventure, without the
downsides of 2018's experiment. In 2018, teams chose which round to unlock,
which was cool, but also meant that you might randomly pick the hardest round
instead of the easiest one, and the organizers had to be prepared for every
possible in-person interaction as soon as teams finished the intro round. It
hasn't come back yet, and I don't think it should.

Our PennyPass strategy
was to optimize for the most open puzzles at once (the width of the hunt).
In each round, solving one puzzle unlocked one other puzzle in that round.
So, solving within a round either kept your width constant, or decreased your
width if you had run out of puzzles to unlock in that round. The only way
to increase width was to unlock new rounds, or use PennyPasses. Our logic
was that we should always use PennyPasses in the most recently unlocked
round, because that round would have the fewest solves, and it would therefore
give a +1 width increase for the longest period of time.

We had one PennyPass left, that would expire in an hour, and the newest round
was Cascade Bay. We had actually unlocked all regular puzzles in every previous
round by that point, so the question was whether to use it in Cascade Bay now,
or to wait an hour to see if we could solve 10 puzzles and unlock Cactus Canyon
before the pass expired. It seemed really unlikely we'd solve 10 puzzles in
an hour, so we spent it on Cascade Bay. Nothing happened.

We had already guessed Cascade Bay's gimmick: puzzles from one level would
"flow down" into puzzles below. But, we didn't realize this meant we needed
to solve the first meta to unlock new puzzles in that round. The Penny Pass
wouldn't kick in until we unlocked the lower levels.

After the Hunt, there was a postmortem assessment of whether we should have
been able to infer the Penny Pass wouldn't do anything due to Cascade Bay's
art, and whether we would have finished 10 puzzles before the Penny Pass
expired to get to use it on Cactus Canyon. We didn't need the extra unlock
in Cascade Bay because we figured out all three metas mechanics pretty
quickly, and we *really* needed the extra unlock in Cactus Canyon because
we got stuck on most of the early puzzles, reducing our effective width to just
2-3 puzzles. teammate was tied with Galactic until Cactus Canyon, and then they
took off, and we may have been able to keep pace with the Penny Pass.

I believe we made the right call in the moment, and even if we had kept pace with
Galactic, I think they still would have figured out the Workshop metameta first.

## Cascade Bay

Jumping to Cascade Bay, I saw my options where progress was happening were
either Breakfast Menu, or The Excelerator. I looked at the people solving
Breakfast Menu, saw "heraldry Waffle House", said "This is amazing. I don't want
to do it.", and looked at The Excelerator instead. We had gotten the phrase
FIND ELEVEN STARTING POINTS, but the solve notes said there were only 10 red
trigrams. Someone looked again, found the 11th, and it was a smooth solve from
there. I helped grind through some trigrams, then confirmed we wanted to read
horizontally along each path, instead of reading vertically down the columns
in ABDEFGHIJK order. (Although, other people were the ones who noticed the
four letter words we got could be read as ranges, and the final extraction
step at the end.)

Solving The Excelerator gave us the 4th solve in Cascade Bay, which was enough
for the meta crew to get the Lazy River meta. I looked at Coast Guard,
trying variations on THROWN FOR A LOOP once we got the idea, but we were missing
both the P and L in the cluephrase, so we ended up getting stuck there for
quite some time. Our forward-solves kept confirming letters in THROWN FOR A
instead.

The Swimming Hole unlocked, someone immediately got acid/base, they placed some
letters and told people they wanted the answer to end in NEUTRALITY, and I
moved back to Safari because I figured they'd finish it up once more forward
solves came in. They did.

## Finishing Safari Adventure

We were quite close to the end of Safari when I got back. We were just missing
3 metas: The Trainer, Anne, and Ms. Cunningham. Meanwhile, Safari Adventure
was open, but we were stuck on extraction - we believed we wanted the
index of the word inside the line it appeared, rather than the line number
itself. I decided to take a look at Ms. Cunningham, which had no progress.
After some false starts, I decided to check who Ms. Cunningham was, which got me
to the TaleSpin connection. Coincidentally, the other
2 metas had break-ins at the same time! My TaleSpin break-in didn't actually
do anything, because we had already assigned the Ms. Cunningham animals by
process of elimination, and the given order of animals isn't the extraction
order, so in effect, my contribution was convincing other solvers we had
made progress on the meta. We solved Safari Adventure with 10 metas done,
got a message saying we needed to finish all the metas, and finished up
Ms. Cunningham, leaving just two rounds left: Creative Picture Studios, and
Cactus Canyon.

## Creative Picture Studios Meta

Most of the puzzles in Creative Picture Studios were solved, which just left
the metapuzzle. A few people had monopolized one of the rooms for several
hours, brainstorming movie plots and moving emojis around.

![Picture of people solving meta](/public/mh20-part2/charlie.jpg)

More solvers filed in after finishing Safari, including me. First there were
3 people yelling movie plots at each, then 4, then 5 and 6. There was a lot
of shouting about what letters to take, and what emojis should go where.
We backsolved The King's Ransom a few minutes before a long-running
forward solve was about to finish. Someone turned to me and said, "There are
too many people here." The two of us left the room to leave it at 4 people
yelling at each other. After 40 minutes (and a few answer lockouts), they
got it.

## Cactus Canyon

During the hunt, we assumed the answer checker timeout was per-round, rather
than per-puzzle. I believe what happened was that we hit the timeout in two
puzzles in a single round at the same time, or we hit the timeout when
people were backsolving two puzzles at the same time.

How we convinced ourselves doesn't matter. What did matter was that our
Creative Picture Studios meta solve had been delayed by 40 minutes due to
rapid guessing, and as a team we were deathly afraid of getting locked out
of submitting to the Cactus Canyon meta. One person working on the meta was
appointed the answer guess dictator, and all guesses had to go through them.

I didn't look at the meta in this round. I made small contributions to TEAMWORK TIME:
Town Hall Meeting (left when I noticed it didn't need many people) and
Wanted: Gangs of Six (IDed a few characters then left). For Spaghetti Western,
I looked up Spaghetti rules, and got stuck on how to figure out the starter
words. Another solver bailed me out, and with the starter words known, I was
able to solve many of the minipuzzles.

Mine Carts was stuck for a long time on trying to pair the Left Track and Right
Track carts. (Yes, we knew the counts didn't work. We tried doing this anyways.)
Someone eventually got the cart-connection a-ha. I embarassingly missed the
My Little Pony connection. (I recognized SPITFIRE, but missed LIGHTNING DUST
until someone put the two together. In my defense, our spreadsheet was a list
of unpaired answers, so I missed the clue that mentioned pony...and also,
Lightning Dust is an asshole character.)

We got GRACE UNDER FIRE as part of our cluephrase, and that gave me an epiphany.
All the Outer Lands had a gimmick to their puzzle structure. Creative Studios
used emojis, Safari had puzzles go to several metas, and Cascade has metas
cascade into lower ones. Clearly Cactus Canyon needed a gimmick as well! When
we got GRACE UNDER FIRE, I mentioned that we had gotten GRACE UNDER FIRE as
an *answer* to The Magic Railway way earlier in the Hunt. Clearly, we were going
to get a bunch of paired connections between puzzles in Cactus Canyon to
other puzzles in the Hunt! This was wrong, but I really wanted it to be true.
