Now that
[My Little Pony: Puzzles are Magic](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/) has
wrapped up, I have time to finish my posts about MIT Mystery Hunt 2020. And
only well over a month after Hunt too!

This post is *long*. I decided to bundle all my remaining thoughts about Hunt
into one post, to motivate me to finish it once and for all. This post will
have spoilers for both MIT Mystery Hunt and Puzzles are Magic.


Before Hunt
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before MIT Mystery Hunt officially starts, people on our team like trying to
identify hidden Mystery Hunt data before the hunt officially starts. This year,
we had two targets: the emails from Left Out, and the wedding invitations.

Every email we got from Left Out had a different signature. There was "Like Pluto,
Left Out". Another said "Like J in a Playfair Cipher, Left Out". Then there was
"Like a cake in the rain, Left Out". Some people felt this was just Left Out's
gimmick (every signature is about something that's left out), but *maybe*
they were a puzzle, so we kept track of all of them.

When we got all the emails about the overnight situation, all without
custom signatures, I argued this was
weak evidence in favor of the emails being a puzzle. The argument went like this:
for the emails to be a puzzle, Left Out would need to make sure they sent out
N exact signatures for some number N. If the signatures were a puzzle,
any surprising emails they needed to
send (like the ones for the overnight situation) shouldn't have custom
signatures, and none of them did.

Someone else pointed out that given the seriousness of the situation, Left Out
wasn't likely to include a jokey signature, whether or not the emails were a
puzzle. That convinced me the emails weren't a puzzle.

The wedding invitations, on the other hand...

![Wedding invite with lines](/public/mh20-part2/hunt_invite.png)
{: .centered }

We recognized the first invite was a reference to the 2011 MIT Mystery Hunt
invitation, but the second invite looked weirder. Why did the alignment look
a little off center? Why was WED LOVE YOU TO JOIN US! missing an apostrophe in
WE'D? Was it just "WED" for "WEDDING", or was it something more? And so on.

Last year, our "is this a puzzle" theories were all in a channel named `#innovated-shitposting`
(later renamed `#ambiguous-shitposting`).
This year, it was `#wed-love-u-2-shitpost`. The working theory was that "join us"
meant "draw connecting lines", "to" meant "connect the 2s", "love" meant
"connect the hearts in 12:00 EST", and "you" mean "connect the letter Us".

So, uh, yeah, that's where all those red lines come from. We also thought it
might have involved folding, so we tried that too.

![Folded invite](/public/mh20-part2/hunt_invite_folded.png)
{: .centered }

As I was boarding my flight to Boston, my position was that the invite was
more-likely-than-not a puzzle (say, 60% chance), but it would come with a shell
that we wouldn't see until Hunt, so until then I wasn't going to try anything.

Meanwhile, two teammates on teammate had a $20 bet on whether the email signatures
were a puzzle. One was adamant they were, the other was adamant they weren't.
They agreed to a bet, and to quote the loser,
"I got a lot less confident in my bet after I read all the emails."

The day before hunt was spent socializing, figuring out who would get
power strips (me), and figuring out our
[Mystery Hunt Bingo](https://www.alexirpan.com/mystery-hunt-bingo/) for the year.
One teammate refreshed until they
got a board that would give a bingo if it had puzzles we wanted to see. ("I like
this board, because we'll get a bingo if there's a puzzle about video games and
a puzzle about anime.")
But, was cherry-picking a bingo board ethical?
We discussed it at the social, and Rahul proclaimed "It's *okay* to cheat at bingo".
Cherry-picked bingo it is.

We did get the bingo line that used video games and anime, although it was a
close call. We needed an anime that came out in the past 2 years, and
Wanted: Gangs of Six came through with
[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure:_Golden_Wind).


A Tangent About Guessing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the minutes before Hunt, we learned there would be an automatic checker
this year. That's as blunt a segue as any to talk about guess rates.

As has been said many times elsewhere, teammate is an outlier on submitting
tons of guesses during Mystery Hunt.
Speaking personally (and definitely not for others on the team),
here's why I tend to guess a lot during Hunt.

To me, good puzzle solvers are distinguished
by their ability to correctly generalize from limited data, solve around
mistakes they've made in data collection, and rapidly form and discard hypotheses
about how a puzzle works. More concretely, if you can reliably solve puzzles
from 80% of the clues, it takes 80% of the time per puzzle. Except, in practice,
it works out to *faster* than 80%, because the last 20% of clues are the hardest
ones.
The same principle holds for metapuzzles. If you can solve a
meta from 60% of the feeders, then you get to skip the hardest 40% of that round,
so you save more like 50% or 60% of the time you'd spend in a
100% forward solve.

Because of this, if you want to solve hunts faster, you should
shortcut as much as you can, and that includes making low
confidence guesses that rely on a few of your assumptions being true. The answer
checker is a binary signal between "all your generalizations were correct", or
"at least one of your generalizations was wrong", and although it's a very
low-bandwidth signal, it's a signal that's there. So if the hunt lets you
be more aggressive on guesses, I'll naturally submit a lot of aspirational
guesses.
It's not
personal towards the puzzle author - their puzzle is one of many puzzles
within the cohesive whole that makes up MIT Mystery Hunt. I'm not going to
abuse [OneLook](https://onelook.com/) to solve a cryptic crossword by itself,
but I may abuse OneLook to solve a cryptic crossword that's part of a larger
hunt, once I've gotten through all the clues that look fun.

Did this pay off? Here's a chart of puzzles solved versus guess accuracy of
that team.

![Solves vs acc all teams](/public/mh20-part2/solves_by_acc_all.png)
{: .centered }

The trend line of this chart definitely suggests that teams with lower guess
accuracy solved more puzzles. But hang on a second: there are bunch of
teams with 100% success rate that only solved a few puzzles. Here's the
same plot, if we remove all teams that solved fewer than 10 puzzles.

![Solves vs acc 10 or more](/public/mh20-part2/solves_by_acc_10ormore.png)
{: .centered }

Now, the downward trend line is gone.

My feeling is that yes, teams that guess more did do better this Hunt. However,
the size of that effect is small, and puzzles solved is still dominated
by general solver ability and luck in how fast a team figures out
the metapuzzles.

One other tangent is that I feel a lot of the discussion about guessing has
focused too much on backsolves. I'm worried
people will think high guess rates come mostly from backsolves. This
isn't true - crazy guesses come from both forward solves and backward solves.

During Puzzles are Magic,
I got curious about forward solve vs backsolve rates. I went through the guess
log, made a list of all answer guesses that looked like backsolves,
and computed forward guesses vs backward guesses for each puzzle.

The results are linked on [the full stats page](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/hunt_stats/).
Excluding meta puzzles and endgame puzzles (puzzles that couldn't be backsolved),
across the entire hunt there were 4.38 guesses per forward solve, and
5.36 guesses per backward solve.
So yes, backsolves did have more guesses on average that hunt, but it wasn't by
a big margin.

Admittedly, because Puzzles are Magic confirmed partials, and had very minimal
rate limiting, we encouraged teams to submit more guesses than they would
in a Mystery Hunt.

I don't think Mystery Hunt should confirm partials, and I do think you want
a strong rate limit if you're doing automatic answer checking.
MIT Mystery Hunt shouldn't need the guardrails that partials give you. We added
those guardrails to Puzzles are Magic just because we wanted an easier hunt.


Puzzle Stories
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

These stories are roughly told in chronological order, but I've grouped
puzzles I worked on by round. During the Hunt itself, I jumped between
rounds much more than mentioned here, so some stories are slightly out
of order.

## Grand Castle and Storybook Forest

I looked around a few puzzles at the beginning, but the one I started first
was [Goldilocks](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/goldilocks/). I filled in a few
clues, then moved to setting up indexing when I failed to get any more clues.

The next one I worked on was [The Trebuchet](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/trebuchet/),
and here it was a similar story.
By the time I got to the puzzle, they had Boggled a few words (the voice
actors from Bolt), and after we realized the ammunition were all puns,
the rest of the walls fell pretty fast. I identified a few more words
(wtf SHAQ LIFE is a show??), then constructed the final wall. We expected
the blocks to fall into place automatically, instead of acting like a dropquote.
I noted we were a few swaps from GEORGE BAILEY, and someone solved it from
FOE OF GEORGE BAILEY.

With that puzzle done, I jumped back to Storybook Forest. I got excited by
[Hackin' the Beanstalk](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/hackin_the_beanstalk/),
immediately recognizing the tortoise-and-hare algorithm when typing random letters.
I opened the sheet for it...and every single algorithm had already been IDed.
Our team has too many CS majors. We had the ordering, and were a bit stuck on
extraction, until someone threw a regex at it and saw [SOURCE FILES](https://nutrimatic.org/?q=%5Bdijkstra%5D%5Bpollard%5D%5Bchudnovsky%5D%5Btarjan%5D%5Beuclid%5D%5Bkadane%5D%5Bfloyd%5D%5Bviterbi%5D%5Bluhn%5D%5Bbresenham%5D%5Bgaleshapley%5D&go=Go) was the first option. It was right.

I looked at [Toddler Tilt](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/toddler_tilt/), which
no one had touched yet. However, I had trouble getting the toddlers to tilt
in the right order. I noticed the people who joined me were getting it much
faster than I was, and I decided my time would be better spent on the meta.

For the [Storybook Forest meta](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/storybook_pals/),
we had some tic-tac-toe theories.
We had a lot of 9 letter answers, and the puzzle art was arranged in a 3 x 3
grid.

![Storybook Forest art](/public/mh20-part2/storybook.png)
{: centered }

(9 puzzles, 3 x 3 grid, three animals in a row in the meta's art. It must mean something!)
{: .centered }

I tried extracting the same way the [Dolphin meta](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2015/puzzle/pod_of_dolphins_meta/solution/) worked from MIT Mystery Hunt 2015. This sort of worked, but
some answers extracted 2 letters instead of one, and there weren't great ways to
use the 11 letter answers. I started looking for tic-tac-toe variants that might
use 11 in an interesting way, and in the middle of doing so, someone who didn't
believe any of our tic-tac-toe work solved the meta.

With that finished, I went back towards [The Grand Castle meta](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/castle/).
We had 4 answers in that round, and after some false starts based on
"stately" and "capital", someone discovered the Texas panhandle. I immediately
noted that the panhandle had 26 counties, but out of the final answer of OILMEN,
A-to-Z conversion of our answers gave LMNO, which made us think it was an
ordering. Each answer in this round was a two word phrase, and reading the
word that wasn't the county gave "MISTER RACHEL UNCERTAIN SIX". I proposed that
the 2nd words were going to form a cryptic whose answer was six letters.
Someone noticed that "Rachel uncertain" might mean anagram RACHEL, giving CHARLE,
which could complete to a famous ruler, CHARLEMAGNE. That sounded great! We tried
it, and it was wrong.

The next feeder we solved was the E from OILMEN, and the second letters gave
this grid.

<table border="1">
    <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>CRISPIN</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>MISTER</td>
    <td>RACHEL</td>
    <td>UNCERTAIN</td>
    <td>SIX</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Ah, so clearly, we were going to fill in the box between CRISPIN and SIX, get
two cryptics that shared SIX for the enumeration, and we'd combine them to get
a 12 letter answer! We tried CHARLEMAGNES (plural), and that was wrong too.
Someone found Six Flags Over Texas, which provided an ordering on the clues,
and now that we had an ordering, A-Z letters looked much better, and we solved
it.

## Spaceopolis, Wizard's Hollow, Balloon Vendor

With those rounds done, it was time to look at Spaceopolis. I watched
our teammates sing [karoake](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/space_karaoke/).
I did data entry and indexing for the Masked Singer a-ha, but the extraction
looked bad. While puzzling over the sheet, someone walked by and asked for
volunteers to solve [Magic Railway](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/magic_railway/),
the konundrum we had just unlocked.
Two of us agreed. I played a mean
house elf master for about an hour, briefly tried chemical elements instead
of classical elements, and got the answer, GRACE UNDER FIRE.
Checking the status sheet, we saw Karoake had been solved The two of
us who left checked to see what we had missed.
It turned out we had extracted the right letters, and just failed to read
properly.

We unlocked [TEAMWORK TIME: Hat Venn-dor](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/hat_venn_dor/),
and joined the effort for that. In general, I really liked the TEAMWORK
TIME puzzles, except for the ones where you only wanted 3 or 4 people interacting
with the puzzle at once. But Hat Venn-dor was well-suited to lots of manic
guessing, and I liked that. After that, some of us had a good laugh at
[No Clue Crossword](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/no_clue_crossword/),
but we didn't get it and had to backsolve the puzzle.
We thought it might have been words that appeared in a crossword clue lookup
when you
[entered "No clue"](https://www.wordplays.com/crossword-solver/no-clue)
as the clue, but that didn't seem very good.
I forget exactly when we got the Balloon Vendor meta, but it was cute.

## YesterdayLand

The next puzzle I did major work on was [Food Court](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/food_court/). The main
thing this puzzle taught me was that I was horribly out of practice on
probability. Back in undergrad, I definitely would have solved all of the
math questions without issue. After solving one of the problems, I saw we had
answers for most questions, so I started transcribing the probabilities into
code to compute the steady state of the Markov chain. Another teammate had
found an online tool for this, but said "it's garbage, it's only accurate
to the hundredths place". That actually would have been good enough for the puzzle,
but due to incorrect data, we weren't getting the right steady states.
Given how the puzzle worked, it seemed clear we needed to check our work.
I loudly went around asking people to help us do math, and was told three
times that someone was on it.
I wasn't really listening (my mistake), and on the third time, they sat me
down and explained that

1. They knew someone who made Nationals of MATHCOUNTS.
2. They weren't doing Hunt, so it was okay to ask them for help.
3. They solved probability problems in their spare time for fun.
4. They were very fast and very accurate.

About 30 minutes later, they got back to us, saying "I believe three of your answers are
wrong, I got this."
We fixed them, reran the Markov chains, and saw the steady states
were all exact hundredths from $$0.01$$ to $$0.26$$, with small errors from
floating-point approximation. So, that was that.

## A Digression on All-or-Nothing Extraction Mechanisms

One big lesson I learned from making Puzzles are Magic is that you always
want to check how robust your puzzle design is to errors.
Solvers
will always, always make errors in solving, even if your clues are 100%
unambiguous. So, if possible, you want to make your puzzle robust to a few
errors. For example, crosswords are naturally robust, because each letter
is checked twice, once by the Across clue and once by the Down clue.

The less robust your puzzle is, the more likely it is that solvers will do
90% of the work for a puzzle without finishing, or they'll apply the right idea
and get garbage due to their mistakes. Either one feels bad. Things
that make a puzzle less robust are partial cluephrases using uncommon letters,
and all-or-nothing extraction mechanisms, where a single error cascades into
complete junk, even with the correct extraction mechanism.

Food Court had an all-or-nothing extraction mechanisms, because
changes to any transition probability *must* influence state probabilities
everywhere else. Otherwise, [Markov chain theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Steady-state_analysis_and_limiting_distributions) says it literally can't have a unique steady state.

I don't like mechanisms like this in a vacuum,
but not every puzzle can be made robust without compromising
its idea.
The core idea of "you solve
a bunch of math problems that seed a Markov chain" is compelling. So, in short,
I liked this puzzle. I think you just have to accept the all-or-nothing
extraction is a consequence of its design, and move on.


## Back to YesterdayLand

Now we come to [Change Machine](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/change_machine/).
Oh boy.

I moved to this puzzle because
I was told there was a lot of mindless drudgery that needed to be done
to the spreadsheet, and I was too tired to do any real solving. The puzzle
was all about the [Omnibus](https://www.omnibusproject.com/) podcast, and
everything was IDed, but they had been IDed independently. Now that the Omnibus
connection had been found, they wanted help merging all the data by Omnibus
episode.

I was still confused, and at some point I said "Okay,
it's 3 AM and I'm very tired. I need you to give me idiot-proof instructions
for what you want me to do." Which they did, so props. After everything was
ordered, I suggested indexing the KJ number into the Bible verse (treating
KJ as short for King James, instead of Ken Jennings).
Reading in episode order gave
AD AMUSEMENT COMPANY IS KEY.

We were confused. During this process, one person had been reading
the Ken Jennings subreddit, and discovered a
[Reddit post where someone asked what the hell was up with the RIDE ENHANCERS COLLECTIVE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurelings/comments/eq3g0v/ride_enhancers_collective/)?

We had a mini mental breakdown. Was this seeded information from Left Out?
Did AD COMPANY mean Reddit? Was this actually how we were supposed to solve
the puzzle?
I dug into the post history of the [Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/user/mr_chan/), to see if they
posted on other puzzle subreddits, but all I found were posts on r/ottawa
and r/Curling, dating back several months. This was made extra confusing because
another Redditor had made Ride Enhancers Collective fanart *in the middle of Hunt*.

![Ride enhancers collective](/public/mh20-part2/ride-enhancers-collective.jpg)
{: .centered }

[(Source)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurelings/comments/eqaxwe/i_made_this_its_not_very_good_but_it_was_just_a/)
{: .centered }

Applying the left-over offset numbers to RIDE ENHANCERS COLLECTIVE was giving
good letters, and that gave the puzzle's answer. That gave us
a much
bigger mental breakdown. (Remember, this is at 3 AM, when the universe
is a magical place and everything is funny in a cosmic sort of way.)
After a bunch of
"WHAT DID WE JUST DO AND WHY DID IT WORK", we figured out that RIDE ENHANCERS COLLECTIVE was
mentioned in an ad from the Omnibus
episode that came out the weekend of Mystery Hunt, and we must have skipped
a bunch of steps that would have told us to listen to the Omnibus.

Reading the
solution, there were three cluephrases, and we only got the last one.
So thank you, Omnibus fans. Your confusion about the RIDE ENHANCERS COLLECTIVE
was not in vain, and your Reddit post provided just enough search engine
signal for us to shortcut the puzzle.

## Big Top Carnival

With that done, I looked at the new [Big Top Carnival](https://pennypark.fun/land/bigtop/) puzzles. I didn't
do much, until someone said, "Hey, so all our answers are
Kentucky Derby horses". We piled onto the meta and got to \*I\*R\*D\*R\*, which
we guessed was "something RIDER". Noticing that horse names had mostly unique
enumerations, we asked if anyone was working on a puzzle in Big Top
with known answer length.
The group working on [Weakest Carouselink](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/weakest_carouselink/) said they had (4 4).
Finding PINK STAR as a horse option, someone proposed PINK SLIP.
The Weakest
Carouselink solvers said "that seems bad", and I pointed out it was thematic to
Weakest Link (you get fired), so we called it in and it was right. That gave
us \*S\*I\*R\*D\*R\*, and within 30 seconds we went from that to
"STIRRUP?" to "STIRRUP DRAMA!" to "AHHHHHH WE SOLVED A META WITH 5 OUT OF 12 ANSWERS".

The really good backsolvers were all asleep, but we had 7 puzzles to backsolve,
of course those of us awake were going to try. We got 3 in the next hour,
got stuck on the rest, and left the backsolves for others to finish up as we
went back to the YesterdayLand meta.

## YesterdayLand Meta

One rather boring puzzle skill I've always been proud of is my diligence in
filling out spreadsheets. When [Jukebox](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/jukebox/)
first unlocked, I opened it, and carefully transcribed the given blanks, their
arrangement, and the colored numbers into the meta spreadsheet. I made some
notes about how I wanted the puzzle to extract, and went off to solve other
puzzles.

After the Big Top Carnival flurry died down, we looked back at Jukebox.
Someone got the modernized answer break-in, and I got a warm fuzzy feeling when
my due diligence meant we could jump straight into filling everything out.
I had DUBSTEP for modernized
DISCO, which seemed okay. That changed to EDM MUSIC, which was worse, but then
someone noticed we had the blanks for ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC, freeing up the
seven-long slot for the modernized PENTHOUSE, PORNHUB. After a brief "oh no
they went there", we had enough to
get to the READ UNDER COLOR NUMBERS cluephrase. We didn't have enough feeders
to get the meta, but I was getting pretty tired, and decided to get some sleep,
trusting it would be done by the time I woke up.

## Saturday's Safari Adventure

After I woke up, I caught up on what had happened.

* The remaining Big Top Carnival puzzles had been backsolved.
* YesterdayLand's meta was solved.
* We finally solved the scavenger hunt, after figuring out all answers in
Creative Picture Studios were emoji.
* We had unlocked Safari Adventure.

I ended up contributing the most to Safari Adventure, which is to be
expected - it was a really big round. For regular puzzles, I worked
on [Golden Wolf](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/golden_wolf/) (figured out the Gashly kids a-ha),
[Lion](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/lion/) (finishing one of
the final NYT puzzles), and [Sheep](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/sheep/) (looking up Mega Man characters,
pointing out all the last words were 11 letters long, and spending an
hour *not* indexing by game number until someone else tried it and solved
the puzzle.) I also worked on [Snake](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/snake/),
where we got IAMB from \*A\*B, guessed
TROCHEES just in case, then got PACES from PACESA (we had some errors that
we guessed through).

I didn't work on [Hyena](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/hyena/), but there is a fun story for it.
The group working on it was convinced one answer was the letters in SRT,
in some order, but they weren't sure what. They decided that, well
there were only 6 permutations, so...

![SRT guesses](/public/mh20-part2/srt_guesses.png)
{: .centered }

Working on the second answer, they got the letters CAM, and again, they
tried 4 of the permutations, but stopped there out of fear of answer locks.
During the Hunt, we thought answer lockouts applied to the entire round.
They didn't want to lock out people forward solving Safari puzzles, so
they abandoned it. Much later, we backsolved Hyena, and discovered the answer
was one of the 2 permutations we hadn't tried.

In the middle of Safari Adventure, we unlocked [First You Visit...](,https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/first_you_visit/).
At the time, we were split across 3 rooms, and it was really funny to hear the
groans cascade across the hall as each room discovered the puzzle 5 seconds
after each other.
Out of Puzzle Traumatic Stress Disorder,
no one worked on it, and we didn't even backsolve it.

For Safari metas, I looked at a few. For
[The Cubs Scout](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/cubs_scout/), my incredibly-minor
baseball knowledge helped with how to read the extracted letters.
In [Sam](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/sam/), I figured
out the stars-and-stripes idea, but didn't get the every other trick. For
[Zeus](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/zeus/), we got Altered Beast really fast,
but got stuck on how to extract. The person who eventually solved it said they
watched an hour of Altered Beast gameplay, then was inspired to map everything
onto BEAST. (Note that nothing about Altered Beast's gameplay was relevant, except
for what animals to use and the ordering of those animals.)

We initially thought the Tiger would be a regular puzzle that was part of
5 metas, which we would have to backsolve entirely. Once we got to a 6th meta
that needed Tiger, we realized it had to be the metameta.
The Safari metas were getting solved pretty fast, and not every meta solver
noted what backsolves were left.
In teammate's tech setup, spreadsheets are made automatically for each new
puzzle, but this breaks down when you're collecting data for a puzzle that
doesn't exist! A group of us ended up making a Tiger spreadsheet manually.
After unlocking [the metameta](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/safari_adventure/),
we transferred our manual sheet to the generated sheet, and while doing so
someone got the Tyger Tyger a-ha, which just left finishing enough Safari
metas to extract.

## A PennyPass Postmortem

I haven't talked about the PennyPass system yet.
In this Hunt, teams would get PennyPasses. Each pass could be spent to unlock
a puzzle in any open round.

I thought this was a neat choose-your-own-unlock-adventure, without the
downsides of 2018's experiment. In 2018, teams chose which round to unlock,
which was cool, but it also meant you might randomly pick the hardest round
instead of the easiest one. The organizers also had to be prepared for
literally every in-person interaction as soon as teams passed the intro round.
It hasn't come back yet, and I don't think it should. It adds randomness and
tons of logistical headaches for not much benefit.

On the other hand, I wouldn't mind seeing the PennyPasses again. They're a nice
way for teams to add help in rounds they decide they need help on. Our strategy was that
unless we were obviously stuck, we would optimize for the width of the Hunt -
the number of unlocked puzzles.

In each round, solving one puzzle unlocked one more puzzle in that round.
So, solving within a round either kept your width constant, or decreased your
width if you had no more puzzles to unlock in that round. This meant that
we always used PennyPasses on the most recently unlocked round, because that
round would have the fewest solves, and we'd have a +1 width increase for the
longest period of time.

We had one PennyPass left, that was expiring in an hour, and the only round it
was valid for was Cascade Bay, since we had unlocked everything else. We therefore
had two options.

1. Use it right away on Cascade Bay.
2. Wait to see if
we could solve the 10 puzzles we needed to unlock Cactus Canyon, and use it there.

It seemed really unlikely we'd solve 10 puzzles in
an hour, so we spent the pass on Cascade Bay. The pass disappeared, but nothing
happened.

We had already guessed Cascade Bay's gimmick: puzzles from one level would
"flow down" into puzzles below. But, we didn't realize this meant the first
meta bottlenecked unlocks in the next level. Our PennyPass wasn't going to
give us a new unlock until we finished more of Cascade Bay.

After the Hunt, there was a postmortem on whether we should have been able
to infer that the PennyPass would work this way, based on Cascade Bay's
art. With our backsolving speed on Safari, we actually may have finished
10 puzzles before the Penny Pass expired, and we heavily needed more unlocks
in Cactus Canyon at the end of Hunt.
By the time the extra unlock kicked in for Cascade Bay, we had already figured
out all three meta mechanics, and didn't need more help.

teammate was tied with Galactic until Cactus Canyon, where they separated from
everyone else.
If we had been able to use the PennyPass on Cactus Canyon, we may have been
able to keep pace.
I believe we made the right call for the PennyPass in the moment, and even if
we had kept pace with Galactic, I think they still would have figured out the
Workshop metameta first, but it's hard to say.

## Cascade Bay

Now that we knew we needed solves in Cascade Bay, the call went out for
unattached solvers to help solve puzzles in that round. We had solved
[Water Guns](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/water_guns/) thanks to an insight
from a remote solver, but that still left several puzzles to finish.

I saw my options were
[Breakfast Menu](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/breakfast_menu/), or [The Excelerator](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/excelerator/). I looked at the people solving
Breakfast Menu, saw "heraldry Waffle House", and went "This is amazing. I don't want
to do it." The Excelerator it is!

It looked crazy, but we had the phrase
FIND ELEVEN STARTING POINTS. The previous solvers had only found 10 red
trigrams, not 11. On a second look, we found the 11th, and it was a decently
smooth solve from there. I grinded through some trigrams, and confirmed we
wanted to read horizontally along each chain rather than vertically, but
it was someone else who noted the four letter words could all be treated as ranges.
We had some trouble getting all the range formulas to work, because Google
Sheets "helpfully" reorders ranges that are written in reverse order, but
besides that it was neat.

Solving The Excelerator gave us the 4th solve in Cascade Bay, which was enough
for the meta crew to get the [Lazy River](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/lazy_river/)
meta. For [Coast Guard](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/coast_guard/), we had variations
on
THROWN FOR A LOOP for ages, but were missing the P and L in the
cluephrase. Our forward solves kept confirming letters in THROWN FOR A,
and we didn't solve the meta until we finally, finally got the P from a forward
solve.

[The Swimming Hole](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/swimming_hole/) unlocked, the
meta crew immediately got acid/base, they got some letters and told people
they wanted the answer to end in NEUTRALITY, and I
moved back to Safari because I figured they'd finish in a few more forward
solves, and I wanted to try breaking open more metas.

## Finishing Safari Adventure

We were quite close to the end of Safari when I got back. We were just missing
3 metas: The Trainer, Anne, and Ms. Cunningham. Meanwhile, we were stuck
trying to take the index of the Tyger Tyger word inside the line it appeared,
instead of converting the line number to a letter.

I took a look at [Ms. Cunningham](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/ms_cunningham/),
which had no progress.
After some false starts, I decided to look up who Ms. Cunningham was, which got
me to TaleSpin. Coincidentally, the other
2 metas had break-ins at the same time, and everyone got really excited
about finally closing out the round.

My TaleSpin break-in didn't actually do anything, because we had already
determined the Ms. Cunningham animals by process of elimination, and the
given clues weren't even the extraction order. In effect, my only contribution
was convincing other solvers we had made progress when we hadn't, but hey, I claim that
still counts.

We solved Safari Adventure metameta with 10 of the 11 metas, got a message saying we
should finish all the metas as well. and solved Ms. Cunningham a few minutes
later, leaving just two things left:
Creative Picture Studios meta, and all of Cactus Canyon.

## Creative Picture Studios Meta

A few people had monopolized a whiteboard for several
hours, brainstorming movie plots and moving emojis around.

![Picture of people solving meta](/public/mh20-part2/charlie.jpg)
{: .centered }

They had made a lot of progress, including a backsolve of [King's Ransom](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/kings_ransom/) minutes before an hours-long forward solve was about to finish.

First, there were 3 people yelling movie plots at each other. Then 4, then 5,
then 6. There was a lot of shouting about letters to take, which emojis should
go where, and guesses on where the missing movies would fit chronologically.
A teammate turned to me and said, "There are too many people here." The two of
us left the room to leave it at 4 people yelling at each other, figuring that
would be good enough.
After 40 minutes (caused by two answer lockouts), they got it.

## Cactus Canyon

I didn't look at the meta in this round. I made small contributions to
[TEAMWORK TIME: Town Hall Meeting](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/town_hall_meeting/) (left when I noticed it didn't need many people) and
[Wanted: Gangs of Six](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/wanted_gangs/) (identified the ponies, Big Hero 6, some
Watchmen, then left).

For [Spaghetti Western](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/spaghetti_western/),
I looked up Spaghetti rules, and got stuck on how to figure out the starter
words. Another solver bailed me out by getting the starter words, and with
those, the minipuzzles got a lot easier.

[Mine Carts](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/mine_carts/) was stuck for a long time on trying to pair the Left Track and Right
Track carts. (Yes, we knew the counts didn't work for this. Yes, we tried
pairing them anyways.) Eventually we figured out we should form a chain
between the carts in each track.
Embarrassingly, I missed the My Little Pony chain. In my defense, our spreadsheet
was a list of unpaired answers, so I missed that each mine cart mentioned
the category we wanted. I recognized
SPITFIRE was a pony (she has a [fun pony music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp0u7vHLqTs)),
but missed LIGHTNING DUST. (I knew who she was, she's a key part of two
episodes, but she's also an asshole).

We got GRACE UNDER FIRE as part of extraction for Mine Carts, and that gave me an epiphany.
GRACE UNDER FIRE was the answer to Magic Railway! All the Outer Lands had a gimmick
to their puzzle structure.
Creative Studios used emojis, Safari had puzzles go to several metas.
Cascade has metas cascade into lower ones. This had to be the Cactus Canyon gimmick!
We were going to get pairings between Cactus Canyon puzzles and other puzzles
in the Hunt, and this would be relevant to the meta! All of this was wrong, but
I really wanted it to be true.

As we moved to the next stuck puzzle, the people we sent to the Workshop came
back with more pennies, and the news that a team had just solved Cactus Canyon's
meta.

"Wait, what? How do you know?"

Here's what happened: as they left the Workshop, they heard the solve jingle
for Cactus Canyon from the Tinkerer's computer. Why
would the Tinkerer from Left Out have solve jingles? Well, suppose a team solved a meta. Left Out would want to
prepare for that team picking up their penny. What if they reused the solving
jingles to let the Workshop person know what round to prepare? If that were
true, then the Cactus Canyony jingle meant a team had just solved Cactus
Canyon's meta, and they were about to start endgame.

This all sounded plausible, but if it was true, there was nothing we could do
about it besides solve more puzzles. (We caught up with Galactic people after,
and confirmed our penny pick-up matched their Cactus Canyon solve time, so
our hunch was correct.)

Remember how I said we thought answer lockouts were per-round? The 40 minute
delay in solving the Creative Studios meta was weighing heavily on people's
minds, and we ended up appointing an answer guess dictator. All guesses had to
go through them. This led to some tense moments - on opening [Cowboy Campfire](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/cowboy_campfire/), many of us wanted to immediately backsolve with
HOMECOOKED MEAL for theme reasons, but were overruled because the number of
clues didn't match answer length.

The last puzzle I worked on was [Snack Bar](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/snack_bar/).
Most of the hard work had been done already, and we split between trying to
find new flavors, checking our existing flavors, and trying different arrangements
of the flavors in the grid.
At one point, we had 10 different copies of the
grid, with everyone making copies trying to find a good arrangement.
It got complicated when
two people duplicated a sheet at the same time. It turns out Google Sheets
does not like this, giving you sheet names like "Conflict_of_23812739".

One of us reported having something promising. We all moved to
"Copy of Copy of Copy of Nathan's sheet", and solved it. The answer
for Snack Bar was very surprising to the meta crew, resolved a bunch of
ambiguity (still not sure how), and was the last answer they needed to solve
Cactus Canyon's meta.

## Workshop

If you're interested in the story for this, you can go read Part 1. The short
version is: we got very excited, left our HQ to pick up the last penny, got
stuck, got *extra* stuck, and retreated back to HQ as our laptop batteries
started dying.

We set aside some floor space for the pennies, and had people cycling between
looking at the pennies, looking at our spreadsheets, and backsolving puzzles
when people got sick of doing either of those two things.

There was nothing unfair about this puzzle. It was just hard. There was a lot of
data, and the phrases were tricky to find if you didn't know what you were looking
for. You needed to look at both the text and pictures to have a chance
of getting the a-ha, but only our physical copy had the text and pictures
co-located with each other - all our digital copies either had just the text,
or just the pictures, but never both side-by-side.

We have really good
solvers on teammate, for all types of puzzles, but I believe our edge is that
we have a strong team-wide intuition for when we can use tools and programming
to speed up solving, or to skip insights entirely through brute force. For example,
although we didn't solve [High Noon Duel](https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/duel/),
our solve went like this.

1. Identified the movies and characters.
2. Got stuck.
3. Note that there are 14 pairs of clues, so there are 14! different pairings of
cowboys to get semaphore.
4. That's a bit big for brute force (87 billion), but not impossible with
some heuristics, assuming the reading order was by the given order of
left cowboys.
5. I put together a short script to generate random pairings, and reported that
about 14% of permutations gave valid semaphore, approximately 1 in 7.
6. Since there are repeat directions in the black cowboys, we have much less than
14! permutations. If we combined lazy unique permutation generation with the
1 in 7 filtering, then added some English language heuristics on top, it
should be brute-forceable.

Would this have worked if we coded it up? Well, no, because the cluephrase
wouldn't make sense without understanding the puzzle's intended mechanic.
I
mention it because 3 people, all new to the puzzle, independently asked if
we should try brute force.

As another example, we gave [Number Hunting](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/puzzle/number-hunting/)
from Puzzles are Magic to a few different testsolvers. This is all very
anecdotal, but many of the testsolvers from teammate
had the same realization - once you solve enough to find the list of
candidate answers,
it's much faster to export the list of all answers, and use coding to search
for matching answer enumerations, instead of forward solving the clues.
When I checked the
[stats for Number Hunting](https://www.puzzlesaremagic.com/stats/number-hunting/), I was not surprised that a teammate team got the fastest solve. That's just how we are as a team.

The pennies were definitely not a puzzle where coding trickery or tool knowledge
got you to the answer faster. You just had to solve it. We didn't.

## Runaround

After Galactic found the coin, Left Out called us to give us hints, and we decided
we'd rather jump straight to the runaround instead of solving Workshop.

I did the runaround for Cascade Bay. Our gimmick was on the easier side. We
played the role of water inside a water pipe, starting in a water pipe above
a sign on MIT campus. Along the way, we looped through an all-gender restroom,
got lost in some walls, came out of some sprinklers, and solved the puzzle by
getting our last letters from some nautical ships.

Meeting back at Left Out's HQ for the finale, we brought back the Heart of the
Park. At one climactic moment, we were supposed to chant the Workshop answer,
but because we skipped past it, we ended up changing "SPOILER FREE ANSWER PHRASE,
SPOILER FREE ANSWER PHRASE", which was delightfully goofy.

I know there are videos of the finale at wrap-up. What that video doesn't
capture is that for some reason, there are *twelve* projector screens in that room. It
is one thing to watch the final Penny Park video. It is another to have it
broadcasted to you from twelve screens covering every wall in sight.

# Closing Thoughts

I really liked this year's Mystery Hunt. The puzzle structure got stretched
in neat ways, there were a lot of in-person puzzles this year (a side-effect of
automatic answer checking freeing up people elsewhere?), and the production
value was nuts. Seriously, they made puzzle-specific art in a consistent
style for every puzzle in the Hunt? I'm not sure people realize how insane
that is. It's completely insane.

I'm not sure if this was intentional on Left Out's part, but in lieu of the Coin,
we distributed the pressed pennies instead, as mini-Coins. I joked that
"oh boy, I get to keep a reminder of the puzzle that caused us incredible
pain", but you know what, it really doesn't hurt at all anymore, and the penny
still looks nice.

As for what's next: teammate and Galactic had an agreement that if either team
won, we'd help each other write Hunt. Some of teammate is joining Galactic
to write, but some are planning to solve instead. The team is reckoning with an uncomfortable chain
of facts: there's a chance we could win Hunt, and the team wants to win Hunt
if we're in position to, but we were implicitly relying on help from Galactic
to write Hunt if we won. Assuming that no one wants to write MIT Mystery Hunt
two years in a row, if teammate wins next year, the cavalry's not coming
from Galactic. It will be less **WHOOSH** *Galactic Trendsetters!* **NYEEEOW**,
and more **WHOOSH** *please let us sleep* **ZZZZZZZ**.

The skill set to win Hunt is not the same as
the skill set to write Hunt. There's definitely heavy overlap, since experienced
solvers know what good puzzles look like, but that still leaves all the
time estimation, organization, theming, and tech required to make the Hunt
tick.
MIT Mystery Hunt exists because people keep making it happen,
and if you can win Hunt, you have the responsibility of continuing to make
it happen. The most direct consequence of our strong performance this year is
that teammate has had serious discussions about how we can build more puzzle
writing expertise.

And, that's it for MIT Mystery Hunt 2020. Jeez, this got really, really long. For puzzlers looking for
new hunts,
[Cryptex Hunt](http://www.cryptexhunt.com/2020/)
starts in a few days. It's my first time doing it, so no idea what to expect,
but it should be fun.
