(N) days ago, DeepMind broadcasted a demonstration of their Starcraft 2 agent
AlphaStar. It successfully beat two pro players from TeamLiquid, TLO (a Zerg
player) and MaNa (a Protoss player).

This has made some waves.

Notes
* The APM limits, is superhuman micro a big deal or not
* The economy of attention, link to Day-9 video, forcing high APM situations
* Cover macro vs micro and why good micro is hard,
** Microing assuming you continue the engagement is a mechanical thing computers
could be good at, but when you add in whether to engage or not, it gets much
harder
** "Learning to harass"
* Pretty good to really good is a smaller step than getting something pretty
  good in the first place.
* Citation of Observer getting built as soon as Dark Templars enter vision.
** Artosis commentary over games?
* Macro decisions of constant probe building (vs stopping probes to save up
  minerals for Nexus)
* Viewing whole map at once vs requiring camera movements
* Bring up older Starcraft AIs?
* 5-10 year prediction broken and discussion on that.
