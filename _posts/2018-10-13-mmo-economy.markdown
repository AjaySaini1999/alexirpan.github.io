What is Neopets?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neopets is a website about Neopets, cute animals you can own as pets. The main
currency of Neopets is Neopoints, abbreviated NP. You earn NP from playing Flash
games, getting lucky from random events, and playing the market.

It was biggest in the early 2000s, then faded from relevance, but it's still
around. I like to check it out now and then, mostly for nostalgia reasons.

Outside of owning Neopets, what you do in the game is up to you.
There's no clear goal to Neopets, and I think that's why it manages to stick
around - everyone finds some goal that keeps them around. Some just play the
Flash games. Others become collectors of weird items. A few (like myself)
get into the battling scene, leveling up their pet at the Neopets training
schools and saving up Neopoints for powerful weapons.

Like I said. It's all up to you.

What isn't up to you are the laws of supply and demand. In the end, most goals
cost something, and any game that's run for 18 years is bound to have its share
of economic stories.


That Time Neopets Created a Scarce Good by Changing Pet Artwork
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2007, the Neopets team standardized all Neopet artwork, such that all Neopets
of a species would have the same pose, regardless of color.

IMAGE

This was done to reduce the art load for a few features, like clothing. With
a standard pose, the clothes can simply be overlaid on top of the Neopet.
Many outfits are only buyable with NeoCash, the pay-to-win currency, so there
are some pretty clear monetary reasons involved.

This made some users very upset. They felt that the new artwork removed the
charm of some of the old artwork.

COMPARISON

Not all the new artwork was completed at the time of the switch, so depending
on the pet and color combination, some pets kept their old art. The community
started calling them unconverted pets, or UC pets for short. For their part, although the Neopets team did not
undo the conversion, they did make pet conversion optional. A pet's art gets
converted if the user changes its color or equips any clothes.

Since every new pet is defaulted to the new artwork, and new UC pets are impossible
to create, these UC pets are now a scarce good. There's a fixed supply, and it's
only going down in the future. Owning a UC pet is a bit of a status symbol,
and although some genuinely prefer the old art, others simply treat them as a
valuable bargaining chip.

You can read more about this topic from [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/2xpejk/so_whats_the_deal_with_unconverted_neopets/)
and [the Neopets wiki](http://neopets.wikia.com/wiki/Unconverted). When
researching this, I even found a site where [you can buy UC pets](https://neopointsdeals.com/neopets/buy-unconverted-neopets/),
including classifications based on how well the Neopet is named, which I
find hilarious.


That Time People Abused a Duplication Glitch and Crashed the High-End Economy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2014, Neopets was sold from Viacom to JumpStart. During the server move, a
bunch of things...just stopped working. Among the issues was a duping glitch.
By doing a certain series of actions, you could duplicate arbitrary items.

There are several Neopets items that cost hundreds of millions of Neopoints, due
to having very limited supply and very strong effects. A few trolls decided
to duplicate a bunch of expensive items, then sell them for deliberately
low prices.

Credit to NeopointsDeals for the following pictures, documenting the madness
that was going on.

PICTURES

You have to imagine how annoyed some exploiters must have felt. If everyone
who knew of the glitch had silently duped a few items, they could have made as
many Neopoints as they wanted. Instead, the glitch immediately got patched.

Oh, by "immediately", I mean 4 days later. And they didn't rollback the
servers. Instead, the Neopets team said they would ban people who took advantage
of the duping glitch. They also removed any items they could trace to the duping
glitch.

Now consider that there is no way to tell whether an item was duplicated or not,
making it impossible to definitively know whether the item you're buying will be
wiped or not.

Yeah.

You can see some of the frustration [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/2i0jjc/duping_glitches_and_broken_things_megathread/).
People ended up adopting a smell test, based on account age and price. New
accounts are sketchy, and weirdly low prices are suspicious. The thing is, the
Neopets team was only able to track down people with terrible operational
security. Plenty of people silently abused the glitch without getting caught.

Things settled down, but it was clear not all duplicated items were removed.
Super Attack Peas used to be one of the most valuable items in the game,
costing over a billion Neopoints. Nowadays, people ask for something between
100 million and 300 million NP, but it's hard to know for sure. Items of that
rarity are sold through the Trading Post. Requested prices are public
and deals that actually close are private, making it hard to figure out the
real price they're trading at.

Speaking of which...


That Time the Neopets Team Finally Increased the Max Shop Price
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a long, long, long, looooooooooong time, the max price you could list a
item at was 99,999 NP. If your item cost 100,000 NP or more, you would have
to list it in the Auction House or on the Trading Post.

This made it very annoying to buy expensive items. User shops are biased in
favor of the buyer. The Shop Wizard is a built-in search engine that finds the
lowest list price of an item across all user stores, making it easy to find the
best deal.

The Auction House is also buyer favored, but for high end items, it usually isn't
used except to close out deals agreed on through the Trading Post.

The Trading Post is seller favored. To buy off the Trading Post, first you need
to search the listings to find your item. Then you need to haggle with the seller, make a reasonable bid, and wait for them to accept it. This can lead to several days of turnaround in the worst case.

If you want to figure out what a fair price is, good luck. When I've tried to buy
rare items, I would often only find 2 listings with my item, both marked with
"NeoMail me your offers".

Fan sites aggregate price estimates based on offers people ask for in
Trading Post listings, but these requested offers are usually a bit optimistic,
and you can often buy for less than the requested price. Since closed Trading
Post deals are private, no fan site can aggregate the true market price. The
information asymmetry means that only active buyers and selleres of an item
know the true market value.

Recently, the max shop price was increased from 99,999 NP to 999,999 NP.
It was a nice change, and one of the side effects was that prices for items
under 1,000,000 NP started dropping, as the information asymmetries went
away.

At the time, I was selling Turned Tooths, a powerful budget weapon.
Trading Post listings asked for between 150,000 NP and 250,000 NP, but I had
been selling them at 99,999 NP in my shop. I was partly impatient, but I
also knew that several newly released free weapons were better than Turned Tooth,
and the price would be crashing soon. Sure enough, when people listed their
Turned Tooths in their shops at 150,000 NP, they learned there was no demand
at that price. Turned Tooths are now about 45,000 NP.


That Time a Book Got 1000 Times More Expensive Because of Charity
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a secret about Neopets: 99% of the items are useless. The only time you
buy them is when some NPC gives you a quest that asks for them.

Despite this, some useless items still have high prices. Items in Neopets have
a rarity system, explained [here](http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=item_rarities_explained).
For our purposes, the important rarities are Rarity 1-99. These items are
buyable from NPC shops, with the rarity defining how rarely that item appears.
Rarity 99 items appear exceptionally rarely. All of them command large prices
because this, and many users like trying to collect all rarity 99 items in the
game.

Let's talk about the Charity Corner. It's an event Neopets occasionally runs,
where the lore is that you donate gifts or school supplies to Neopians who
need it. Awwwww.

The way it works changes each year, but here's how it worked in 2015 and 2017.
There were three rarity bands: r70-79, r80-89, and r90-99. They specify a category,
like books. For every five items you donate, you get back a random item sampled
from the rarity band you donated.

For example, you donate five rarity 90 books, and you potentially get back a
rarity 99 item.

Now consider that the item you get back *isn't* weighted by rarity (giving
you solid chances of hitting a rarity 99 item), and many items with rarities in
the low 90s are dirt cheap.

No surprises for what happened next: users began buying out the cheapest rarity 90
items they could find, swarming to the next cheapest item once other users
adjusted their prices accordingly.

JellyNeo tracks historical logs of item prices. Here's the price log for
[Realm of the Water Faeries], a rarity 92 book. Can you guess when Charity
Corner ran that year?

IMAGE

Here's the 2017 spike, with a more modest spike of 100x instead of 1000x.

IMAGE

(Incidentally, one of the follow-on effects was that Illusen's Staff and
Wand of the Dark Faerie plummeted in price. These items are obtainable through
the Illusen quests and Jhudora quests. Each day, they ask for an item. The more
times you succeeed in a row, the rarer the item gets. After a certain point, they
only ask for rarity 99 items. The influx of new rarity 99 items made completing
these quests much cheaper. In 2009, a Wand of the Dark Faerie was estimated at
about 350 million NP. It's now about 40 million NP.


That Time Neopets Got a User to Donate a Billion Neopoints to Charity
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

All MMO economies are defined by their inflows and outflows. How does in-game
currency get created, and how does it get deleted?

Take MapleStory, a game I also played a lot in my youth. The in-game currency
is Mesos. Monsters drops Mesos on death. When you buy from an NPC shop, the Mesos
spent disappear. When you trade with a user, a small percentage of the Mesos
spent is removed as tax.

Why does this tax exist? The game used to not have a tax, but the game devs
learned that mesos were getting added faster than they were getting removed.
Items with the most value were sold by users, not by NPCs, and shuffling Mesos
between users doesn't remove money from the overall system. As the net Mesos
in the economy increased, prices of items inflated. The tax was added to slow
down inflation.

In Neopets, NP enters the system through Flash games, and leaves from NPC
shops and various gambling games.
NPC shops do sell desirable items, but they do so at low prices. In fact,
there's a practice called restocking, where you camp a shop until a rare item
goes on sale, buy it for cheap, then sell it on the user market at a much
higher price. As a kid, I thought restocking was magical. I remember playing
Neopets from my local library, because they had a super fast Internet connection, and in a Neopets
restock war, milliseconds matter. It was like high-frequency trading, except
it was done by millions of children instead of bots.

As an adult, I now recognize the profit from restocking is basically the
free market paying you Neopoints for the time spent refreshing an NPC shop
waiting for good items to appear.

(From a game design point, this price scalping is actually good for the game.
It gives players a reason to spend at NPC shops, and it gives new players
another source of income.)

(This may remind you of stories from communist countries, where people
line up to buy a limited quota of food at a government-mandated price, then
buy the food they need to live from the black market at a much larger price.
The difference is that Neopets is a game, and your life isn't as bad if you
miss out on a Neopoint making opportunity.)

Unlike MapleStory, Neopets didn't have a transaction tax. Without this balancer,
the existing Neopoints sinks weren't big enough. Prices started rising and
users wrote editorials asking the team to introduce more NP sinks to the economy.

They did. In fact, they added several. Two I find really funny are:

*The Lever of Doom:* Pulling this lever makes you lose 100 NP. Every pull has
a small probability of giving you a Lever of Doom avatar you can use on the
Neopets message boards. Some avatar hunters ended up spending millions of
NP chasing that avatar.

*The Hidden Tower Grimoires:* The Hidden Tower is a special NPC shop. Items
never got out of stock, and they're all very expensive. Most Hidden Tower items
can be bought from users at a slight discount, making them an ineffective NP
sink. The Hidden Tower Grimoires are books, entirely untradeable, only buyable
from the Hidden Tower, with the most expensive one costing 10,000,000 NP.
Each book grants an avatar when read, disappearing on use.

Remember the story of the iPhone app "I'm Rich", that cost $1000 and did
literally nothing? Using the most expensive Grimoire avatar is very, very close
to that.

These sort of helped the problem, but didn't help enough. Eventually,
the team decided to go all out, announcing the Save the Wheels initiative.

The Wheels are a feature where you pay a small NP fee to spin a wheel to
get prizes. The in-lore justification for Save the Wheels was that the Wheels
heavily needed renovations, and Neopians were asked to donate money to fund
those renovations. The practical reason was that the Neopets team really
needed people to willingly give up their Neopoints.

To incentivize this, each donation came with an item. The more you donate,
the better the item. The most expensive item required a 2,000,000 NP donation.
They also kept a leaderboard of the top ten users by Neopoints donated.

In many ways, Neopets is a zombie site. The flip side is that many users have
come back after years of hiatus, dug through their storage, and learned that
a stamp they got from an event ten years ago is now worth millions because it's
part of a stamp collection and was only given out at that event. Any time
there's an event that gives out items which will never be given out again,
you can be sure that someone will get as many as they can as an investment
strategy.

It was a bit riduclous, but the Save the Wheels initiative worked.
Users donated over 12 *billion* Neopoints in total, with the top user donating
1 billion Neopoints.

The central lesson here is that it's really hard to escape economics. It has
this nasty habit of showing up everywhere you look.

Funnily enough, this isn't the first post about the Neopets economy. There
have been other posts, some about [inflation](https://www.themarysue.com/neopets-economy/),
and others that [contrast it with the failures of capitalism](https://medium.com/nimbly-aware/the-bourgeoisie-online-a-review-of-the-neopets-economy-4963d0a0f845).

On one level, yes, there is definitely a Neopets top 1%, that barters in
millions while others earn 5000 NP a day. As noted by [this editorial](http://www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=468018&week=412),
most of the top 1% earn NP by buying and selling from others in the top 1%. From
their perspective, commoners basically don't exist.

On the other hand, Neopets doesn't cost anything to play. Feeding your Neopets
costs 5 NP a day. The Flash games are entirely free as well. The strongest
criticism of unrestricted capitalism is that some are forced into terrible
conditions to earn enough to live, but this just isn't a thing in Neopets.
Neopoints are just the vehicle for buying things that other people also want.

It reminds me of a quote from the (profanity-filled)
[Zero Punctuation review of Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wgQvij3rVE).

Neopets only works as a game *because* it requires effort to get many of things
it offers. If anything transfers from Neopets to the real world, it's that we
like a challenge, and we like goals, and we like aiming for something, as long
as the path is fun enough to keep following.
