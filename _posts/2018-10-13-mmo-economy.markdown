What is Neopets?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neopets is a website about Neopets, cute animals you can own as pets. The main
currency of Neopets is Neopoints, abbreviated NP. You earn NP from playing Flash
games, getting lucky from random events, and playing the market.

It was biggest in the early 2000s, then faded from relevance, but it's still
around. I like to check it out now and then, mostly for nostalgia reasons.

Outside of owning Neopets, what you do in the game is up to you.
There's no clear goal to Neopets, and I think that's why it manages to stick
around - everyone finds some goal that keeps them around. Some just play the
Flash games. Others become collectors of weird items. A few (like myself)
get into the battling scene, leveling up their pet at the Neopets training
schools and saving up Neopoints for powerful weapons.

Like I said. It's all up to you.

What isn't up to you are the laws of supply and demand. In the end, most goals
cost something, and any game that's run for 18 years is bound to have its share
of economic stories.


That Time Neopets Created a Scarce Good by Changing Pet Artwork
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2007, the Neopets team standardized all Neopet artwork, such that all Neopets
of a species would have the same pose, regardless of color.

IMAGE

This was done to reduce the art load for a few features, like clothing. With
a standard pose, the clothes can simply be overlaid on top of the Neopet.
Many outfits are only buyable with NeoCash, the pay-to-win currency, so there
are some pretty clear monetary reasons involved.

This made some users very upset. They felt that the new artwork removed the
charm of some of the old artwork.

COMPARISON

Not all the new artwork was completed at the time of the switch, so depending
on the pet and color combination, some pets kept their old art. The community
started calling them unconverted pets, or UC pets for short. For their part, although the Neopets team did not
undo the conversion, they did make pet conversion optional. A pet's art gets
converted if the user changes its color or equips any clothes.

Since every new pet is defaulted to the new artwork, and new UC pets are impossible
to create, these UC pets are now a scarce good. There's a fixed supply, and it's
only going down in the future. Owning a UC pet is a bit of a status symbol,
and although some genuinely prefer the old art, others simply treat them as a
valuable bargaining chip.

You can read more about this topic from [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/2xpejk/so_whats_the_deal_with_unconverted_neopets/)
and [the Neopets wiki](http://neopets.wikia.com/wiki/Unconverted). When
researching this, I even found a site where [you can buy UC pets](https://neopointsdeals.com/neopets/buy-unconverted-neopets/),
including classifications based on how well the Neopet is named, which I
find hilarious.


That Time People Abused a Duplication Glitch and Crashed the High-End Economy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2014, Neopets was sold from Viacom to JumpStart. During the server move, a
bunch of things...just stopped working. Among the issues was a duping glitch.
By doing a certain series of actions, you could duplicate arbitrary items.

There are several Neopets items that cost hundreds of millions of Neopoints, due
to having very limited supply and very strong effects. A few trolls decided
to duplicate a bunch of expensive items, then sell them for deliberately
low prices.

Credit to NeopointsDeals for the following pictures, documenting the madness
that was going on.

PICTURES

You have to imagine how annoyed some exploiters must have felt. If everyone
who knew of the glitch had silently duped a few items, they could have made as
many Neopoints as they wanted. Instead, the glitch immediately got patched.

Oh, by "immediately", I mean 4 days later. And they didn't rollback the
servers. Instead, the Neopets team said they would ban people who took advantage
of the duping glitch. They also removed any items they could trace to the duping
glitch.

Now consider that there is no way to tell whether an item was duplicated or not,
making it impossible to definitively know whether the item you're buying will be
wiped or not.

Yeah.

You can see some of the frustration [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/2i0jjc/duping_glitches_and_broken_things_megathread/).
People ended up adopting a smell test, based on account age and price. New
accounts are sketchy, and weirdly low prices are suspicious. The thing is, the
Neopets team was only able to track down people with terrible operational
security. Plenty of people silently abused the glitch without getting caught.

Things settled down, but it was clear not all duplicated items were removed.
Super Attack Peas used to be one of the most valuable items in the game,
costing over a billion Neopoints. Nowadays, people ask for something between
100 million and 300 million NP, but it's hard to know for sure. Items of that
rarity are sold through the Trading Post. Requested prices are public
and deals that actually close are private, making it hard to figure out the
real price they're trading at.

Speaking of which...


That Time the Neopets Team Finally Increased the Max Shop Price
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a long, long, long, looooooooooong time, the max price you could list a
item at was 99,999 NP. If your item cost 100,000 NP or more, you would have
to list it in the Auction House or on the Trading Post.

This made it very annoying to buy expensive items. User shops are biased in
favor of the buyer. The Shop Wizard is a built-in search engine that finds the
lowest list price of an item across all user stores, making it easy to find the
best deal.

The Auction House is also buyer favored, but for high end items, it usually isn't
used except to close out deals agreed on through the Trading Post.

The Trading Post is seller favored. To buy off the Trading Post, first you need
to search the listings to find your item. Then you need to haggle with the
seller, make a reasonable bid, and wait for them to accept it. This can lead
to several days of turnaround in the worst case.

If you want to figure out what a fair price is, good luck. When I've tried to buy
rare items, I would often only find 2 listings with my item, both marked with
"NeoMail me your offers".

Fan sites aggregate price estimates based on offers people ask for in
Trading Post listings, but these requested offers are usually a bit optimistic,
and you can often buy for less than the requested price. Since closed Trading
Post deals are private, no fan site can aggregate the true market price. The
information asymmetry means that only active buyers and selleres of an item
know the true market value.

Recently, the max shop price was increased from 99,999 NP to 999,999 NP.
It was a nice change, and one of the side effects was that prices for items
under 1,000,000 NP started dropping, as the information asymmetries went
away.

At the time, I was selling Turned Tooths, a powerful budget weapon.
Trading Post listings asked for between 150,000 NP and 250,000 NP, but I had
been selling them at 99,999 NP in my shop. I was partly impatient, but I
also knew that several newly released free weapons were better than Turned Tooth,
and the price would be crashing soon. Sure enough, when people listed their
Turned Tooths in their shops at 150,000 NP, they learned there was no demand
at that price. Turned Tooths are now about 45,000 NP.


That Time Neopets Got a User to Donate a Billion Neopoints to Charity
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Almost all MMOs have the same core problem. The game needs to give all new players
some starting money and a source of income so that they can start building
wealth. For example, monsters may drop in-game currency when they die. In Neopets,
the game provides income through its Flash games. Each game gives up to 1000 NP
per play, up to 3 plays per game per day.

Note this directly *adds* money to the system. When combined with a user-run
economy, in the long run, valuable goods will continue to rise in price, since
the value of 1 Neopoint drops as more Neopoints are in the system.
If left unchecked, you can hit a point where earning 1000 NP at a time isn't
enough to buy anything of worth.

Thus, many MMO economies are driven by ways currency gets added and removed from
their economies. At the start of Neopets, money was removed by NPC shops.
Items sold between players only shuffles Neopoint between users. Items bought
from an NPC shop removes NP entirely.

The way Neopets shops work is pretty simply. Every 7-8 minutes, new items appear
in stock. If a shop sells out, tough luck - you'll have to wait another 8
minutes. Each shop sells certain items, which restock based on their rarity.

This led to a practice called *restocking*. When a rare, in-demand item
goes on sale, you race to buy it before other restockers do. Then you sell it
in your own shop at a much higher price to turn a profit.

As a kid, I thought this was magical. I remember playing Neopets from my local
library, because they had a super fast Internet connection, and in a Neopets
restock war, milliseconds matter. Imagine high-frequency trading, run by
millions of children.

As an adult, I realize it's the free market deciding a price based on scarcity,
and restocking as a time-for-Neopoints tradeoff.

From a game design point, ticket scalpers are good for the economy, since
shopping at NPC shops both reduces inflation and gives new players another
profit-making opportunity.

This sort of works. When a rare, in-demand item goes on sale in an NPC shop, users
quickly buy it until it goes out of stock, then resell it on the user market at
a much higher price. As a kid, I thought this was magical. As an adult, I realize
it's the free market deciding a price based on scarcity, with a time-for-money
tradeoff baked in. Wait for the item in an NPC shop and get it for cheap, or
buy it right away from a user shop at a higher price.

(This may remind you of stories from communistic countries, where people would
line up to buy a limited quota of food at a government-mandated price, then
buy the food they needed to survive from the black market at a heavily increased
price.)

The problem wasn't that Neopets didn't have NP sinks, it was that they weren't
wide enough. Playing Flash games is fun. Constantly refreshing a shop page
is less so. As prices began rising, some users called on Neopets to add more
NP sinks to the system.

Over the course of a few years, they did. Here are some of the funnier ones.

The Lever of Doom! If you pull it, you lose 100 NP. That's all it does. But,
with a very small chance, pulling the Lever of Doom grants you a special avatar
to use on the message boards. Some avatar hunters ended up spending millions of
NP before they hit the Lever of Doom avatar.

PICTURE?

The Hidden Tower Grimoires! The Hidden Tower is a special store in Neopets.
Everything there has a fixed price, they never go out of stock, you can only buy
1 item a day, and the *cheapest* item starts at 500,000 NP. Most cost millions
of NP.

Due to their always-in-stock nature, items from the Hidden Tower are cheaper on
the user market, since users selling their old Hidden Tower items know that
they need to undercut the NPC price to have a chance of a sale. This
incidentally stops people from spending money at the Hidden Tower, limiting the
efficacy of one of the biggest NP sinks in the game.

So, TNT added the Hidden Tower Grimoires. These are books that disappear when
read, are entirely untradeable, and give an avatar for reading each one.
They're called
the Grimoire of the First Order, the Grimoire of Prosperity, and the Grimoire
of Affluence, and cost 100,000 NP, 1,000,000 NP, and 10,000,000 NP respectively.

Remember the story of the iPhone app "I'm Rich", that cost $1000 and did
literally nothing? This is very close to that territory - you spend 10 million
Neopoints to increase your pet's "books read" counter by a bit, and get an
avatar that you can use to say "yes, I'm so rich that I can spend 10 million
Neopoints on a book".

It worked.

The problem with these NP sinks is that they only cater to specific groups
of users. Plenty of people don't care about avatars, or don't care about books.

Eventually, TNT decided, "Screw it, we're going all out." They announced the
Save the Wheels initiative in (CHECK
YEAR). The in-lore storyline was that the gambling Wheels (themselves NP sinks
for the economy) were broken, and heavily needed renovation. For one month,
they collected donations from Neopians, giving out items for each dontation.
The more you donate, the better item you got, with the most expensive one
requiring a 2 million NP donation.

The practical reason was that they wanted to encourage users to remove money
from the economy, and decided a good way to do it would be to give away
special items for 1 month that would never be released again.

I find this scheme the most ridiculous, but it actually *worked*.
Users donated over 12 *billion* Neopoints in total, with the top user donating
1 billion Neopoints by themselves. In many ways, Neopets is a zombie site, but
the flip side is that several users have come back after years of hiatus, and
have discovered that an item in their storage is worth millions due to only
appearing in an event that finished over a decade ago. An old game and old
playerbase has made waiting-on-your-investments a viable NP earning strategy.



That Time a Book Multiplied in Price by 60x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's talk about charity. In recent years, Neopets runs an event called
Charity Corner during the holidays. The lore (CHECK) is that you're donating
gifts to Neopets who don't have anyone to give them Christmas gifts (awwwww).

In previous years, the way it worked was that they gave you a category.
Say, Books. Each item in Neopets has a rarity. You could donate 5 books that
are at most 5 rarity away from one another (say 90 to 95), and would get back
a random item of rarity 5 greater than the largest one, up to rarity 99.
For example, you could donate books of rarity 91,92,93,94,95, and get a random
rarity 99 item.

Here's how rarities work in Neopets

Rarity 98 or lower: pretty common, not very expensive
Rarity 99: ridiculously rare, usually worth something
Rarity 100+: doesn't correlate with cost in any way

See where this is going? Five items of rarity 95 turn into 1 lotto ticket for
a rarity 99 item that could literally be worth hundreds of millions of Neopoints.

Prices for rarity 95 books went from about 800 NP to almost tens of thousands of
Neopoints in just a few days. Meanwhile, prices for rarity 99 items dropped
across the board.

This had some neat follow-on effects. The Illusen and Jhudora quests give a very
powerful weapon if you complete 50 quests in a row, each quest getting harder
to fulfill than the last. Get one wrong, and you have to start all over from
level 1. After a certain point, every quest asks for a rarity 99 item, which
made these weapons very, very expensive. With the increase in R99 items, the prices
dropped to the 25M NP range for Illusen's Staff and 40M NP range for Wand of the
Dark Faerie. Still a bit expensive, but a lot more affordable than it used to
be.

\* \* \*

The central lesson here is that it's really hard to escape economics. It has this
nasty habit of showing up everywhere you look.

But, it's also interesting from a game design perspective. I remember watching a
Zero Punctuation review of Minecraft that described this.

In some sense, Neopets only works as a game *because* some of its items are
scarce. This gives players something to work to.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


At this point, I would like to call out one article in particular.

https://medium.com/nimbly-aware/the-bourgeoisie-online-a-review-of-the-neopets-economy-4963d0a0f845

You see, this isn't the first post about the Neopets economy. There have been
several over the years, but much of the motivation I had to write this article
came from this article in particular.

It criticizes the Neopets article from a socialistic standpoint, essentially
criticizing the economy for its similarities to broken economies of the past,
from a late-stage capitalism persepctive.
