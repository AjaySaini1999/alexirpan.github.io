I've been playing a lot of MapleStory 2 recently, mostly out of nostalgia for
MapleStory 1. I played several MMOs when I was growing up. I never got into
Runescape, or Kingdom of Loathing, two popular MMOs in my age range, but I did
get into Neopets, moved on to MapleStory, then Ragnarok Online after that.

Out of all of those, I'd say Neopets was the most formative MMO. Sure, in terms
of game hours spent, I've probably spent more time on Ragnarok Online or
MapleStory. But Neopets was my *first* MMO, and it was a browser game, making it
easy to play anywhere. The local library had a super-fast Internet connection,
and several of us signed up for computer time for the sole purpose of getting
an edge in Neopets restocking.

It's only with the benefit of hindsight that I can appreciate the economies
that evolved in those MMOs, and in some ways they're actually quite elegant.
They're simpler than real-world economies, but still have solid depth to them.

This post is focused on the Neopets economy, because I understand that
economy better, and after running for over 18 years, you naturally end up with
lots of interesting stories.


What is Neopets?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neopets is a website about Neopets, which are cute animals you can own. You can
buy things for your Neopet with Neopoints (NP), the main currency of the site.
You get Neopoints from playing games, getting lucky from random events, doing
dailies that give you NP, and by selling items to other players.

The thing with Neopets is that you have to make your own goals. Luckily, there
are enough options that you can do a lot of things. Maybe you want to read the
most books, earn a trophy for a game by getting the top score, or collect
stamps, or train your pet so that it can compete in the Battledome, or paint
your Neopet a specific color. Whatever the goal, it usually costs Neopoints
to get there, and that's where the economy comes in.


Inflows and Outflows
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A lot of MMOs run into a similar problem. New players need to have a source of
income so that they can save up and buy the things they want. But there also
need to be ways to remove money from the system, to help reduce inflation.

The way Neopets handles this is actually pretty neat. There are a ton of NPC
shops in Neopets, selling all sorts of stuff, 99% of which has no intrinsic
value. Seriously. But, there are also a bunch of NPC quests that use these
random items. Faeries quests ask for all sorts of knick knacks. Edna,
Kitchen, Esophaghar, and Brain Tree quests also ask for all sorts of things.

That provides the reason to buy items for NPC shops. Common items are almost
always in stock, and the NPC shops set a floor on the market price. But what
about the rare items? Here, we see the economy in action. You can either
wait for the rare item to reappear in stock, or you can buy them directly
from a user shop at a premium.

This leads to a practice the community calls restocking. You sit at an NPC
shop, continually refresh it until rare items reappear in stock, buy them
before other restockers get them, and then sell them in your shop at a profit.

As a kid, I thought it was magical that you could earn thousands or
tens of thousands of NP if you got a good sale. As an adult, I realize it's
basically a time-for-money tradeoff.

Restocking is entirely condoned by the site, and they even included a
restocking penalty, where if you refreshed a shop page too often, you were
locked out of buying items for several minutes. This helped mitigate bots.

Why do I bring up restocking? It's the main engine for removing Neopoints
from the economy! NP spent at NPC shops goes away forever, and NP exchanging
between users doesn't add any extra NP to the system. If restockers spend
enough money at NPC shops, Neopoint inflation should be held in check.

If.

Turns out that didn't happen.


Neopoint Inflation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Neopets system has all the tools needed to keep inflation in check. The
problem was simply a matter of balance. More NP was added than removed, and
over time, prices of various goods started to rise.

To combat this, the staff added more NP sinks to the system. Try the Lever
of Doom! If you pull it, you lose 100 NP. But, with a very small chance,
pulling the Lever of Doom grants you a special avatar to use on the message
boards. Some users are avatar hunters, trying to get every avatar they can,
and people have spent millions on the Lever of Doom.

Buy the Hidden Tower Grimoires! These are untradeable books, only buyable from
the Hidden Tower, the most expensive NPC shops in the game. They're called
the Grimoire of the First Order, the Grimoire of Prosperity, and the Grimoire
of Affluence, and cost 100,000 NP, 1,000,000 NP, and 10,000,000 NP respectively.
Reading each gives you an avatar. It also counts as a book read to your pet.
And some users go very hard on reading more books than any other user.

The problem with these NP sinks is that they only cater to specific groups
of users. Plenty of people don't care about avatars, or don't care about books.
What I find interesting is that *they were added in the first place.* You get
the feeling that people

They then added the Wheel of Extravangance. For 100,000 NP, you can spin the
wheel, and on average, you'll lose money but gain special items or avatars.

Eventually, this came to a head with the Save the Wheels initiative in (CHECK
YEAR). The in-lore storyline was that the Wheels of Excitement, NAME_CHECK,
were broken and needed renovations, so won't you please donate some
Neopoints, and as an added bonus we'll toss in rare items if you donate
a lot! The practical reason was that they desperately
needed to siphon money from the Neopets.

On the face of things, this is a bit ridiculous, but it actually *worked*.
Users donated over 12 *billion* Neopoints in total. In some sense, Neopets
is a zombie site, but the flip side of that is that users have directly seen
how prices of scarce items can shoot up over time, and they have the patience
to wait for their profit to appear.

Through it all, the Neopets economy has managed to stay remarkably stable.
I don't think this was guaranteed to happen. One worry some users had was that
as the game stagnated, players would leave, the supply of key consumables
would dry up, and the economy would collapse as a result. But this didn't
happen. In fact
Yes, the cost of some collectibles (like rare stamps and rare weapons) has
gone up over time.



At this point, I would like to call out one article in particular.

https://medium.com/nimbly-aware/the-bourgeoisie-online-a-review-of-the-neopets-economy-4963d0a0f845

You see, this isn't the first post about the Neopets economy. There have been
several over the years, but much of the motivation I had to write this article
came from this article in particular.

It criticizes the Neopets article from a socialistic standpoint, essentially
criticizing the economy for its similarities to broken economies of the past,
from a late-stage capitalism persepctive.
