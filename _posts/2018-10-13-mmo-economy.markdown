I've been playing a lot of MapleStory 2 recently, mostly out of nostalgia for
MapleStory 1. I played several MMOs when I was growing up. I never got into
Runescape, or Kingdom of Loathing, two popular MMOs in my age range, but I did
get into Neopets, moved on to MapleStory, then Ragnarok Online after that.

Out of all of those, I'd say Neopets was the most formative MMO. Sure, in terms
of game hours spent, I've probably spent more time on Ragnarok Online or
MapleStory. But Neopets was my *first* MMO, and it was a browser game, making it
easy to play anywhere. The local library had a super-fast Internet connection,
and several of us signed up for computer time for the sole purpose of getting
an edge in Neopets restocking.

It's only with the benefit of hindsight that I can appreciate the economies
that evolved in those MMOs, and in some ways they're actually quite elegant.
They're simpler than real-world economies, but still have solid depth to them.

This post is focused on the Neopets economy, because I understand that
economy better, and after running for over 18 years, you naturally end up with
lots of interesting stories.


What is Neopets?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neopets is a website about Neopets, which are cute animals you can own. You can
buy things for your Neopet with Neopoints (NP), the main currency of the site.
You get Neopoints from playing games, getting lucky from random events, doing
dailies that give you NP, and by selling items to other players.

The thing with Neopets is that you have to make your own goals. Luckily, there
are enough options that you can do a lot of things. Maybe you want to read the
most books, earn a trophy for a game by getting the top score, or collect
stamps, or train your pet so that it can compete in the Battledome, or paint
your Neopet a specific color. Whatever the goal, it usually costs Neopoints
to get there, and that's where the economy comes in.


Inflows and Outflows
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A lot of MMOs run into a similar problem. New players need to have a source of
income so that they can save up and buy the things they want. But there also
need to be ways to remove money from the system, to help reduce inflation.

The way Neopets handles this is actually pretty neat. There are a ton of NPC
shops in Neopets, selling all sorts of stuff, 99% of which has no intrinsic
value. Seriously. But, there are also a bunch of NPC quests that use these
random items. Faeries quests ask for all sorts of knick knacks. Edna,
Kitchen, Esophaghar, and Brain Tree quests also ask for all sorts of things.

That provides the reason to buy items for NPC shops, but what do you do if
it isn't on sale? Well, just buy it from another user. And here, we see
market forces in action. Some items restock in NPC shops very rarely, but they
still have similar demand. This opens up an opportunity - you can wait at
a shop until new items go on sale, buy the rare items for the NPC price, then
sell them in the user market for much higher.

This practice is called restocking,

A lot of MMOs end up with a similar problem. The game needs to provide ways
for new players to earn money, but there also have to be reasons for those
players to spend money in ways that remove it from the economy.

(Explain Neopets?)

In Neopets, the main currency is Neopoints (NP). People usually get started by
playing the Flash games, which give 500-1000 NP per play, depending on how
good you were at them. Many of these games have aged very, very poorly, but they're a steady stream
of income.

(In fact, back in the site's heyday, companies would commission sponsored
Flash games advertising their products. These games were often quite generous
with their NP, making them popular attractions.)

Money also came from dailies like Tombola, which could randomly give you
Codestones. What's so special about Codestones? They're the currency used at
the Mystery Island Training School, where you can increase your Neopet's
battling stats.

Right away, there's an elegance to this. To train your Neopet, you can either
wait until the Tombola gives you the random Codestone you need, or you can
pay NP and buy a Codestone sold by another player. Money for time, in one of
its purest forms.

Games aren't the only source of NP. Users can also earn interest from the
Neopets Bank (which caps out at 10% interest per year if you hit 10
million Neopoints), and from the Stock Market.

Some economically minded users noticed a problem. You have all these ways to
add Neopoints into the economy, but without a way to remove them, prices
keep rising.


Handling the Inflation Problem
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neopets inflation is kept in check through NPC stores and various avatars.

In a standard MMORPG, you're leveling up a character and need to buy healing
items. Neopets doesn't really have this. Healing is free from the Healing
Springs, food is free from the Giant Omelette or Neolodge. Instead, the
demand comes from:

* Books, which disappear when read. There are trophies for reading
the most books.
* NPC Quests, like Kitchen Quest, the Brain Tree, and Faerie Quests, all of
which give you bonuses for random knickknacks.
