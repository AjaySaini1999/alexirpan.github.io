I've been playing a lot of MapleStory 2 recently, mostly for nostalgia reasons.
As a kid, I played my share of MMOs, but before MapleStory, I started with one
of the longest running MMOs out there - Neopets.

In terms of game hours spent, I've probably spent more time on Ragnarok Online,
but Neopets was the more formative one that got me into online games. As a kid,
I didn't really appreciate the Neopets economy, besides the basics of
"try to buy low, try to sell high, rare items and good items are expensive".
It's only with the benefit of hindsight that I can appreciate how the Neopets
market evolved.

Neopets is still around today. It's certainly a lot smaller. There's a vague
sense that it's been dying for years and only lives because of nostalgia.
When a game runs for over 18 years, you naturally end up with lots of interesting stories.


What is Neopets?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neopets is a website about Neopets, which are cute animals you can own as
pets. You can buy things for your Neopet with Neopoints (NP), the main currency
of the site. You get Neopoints from playing games, getting lucky from random
events, doing dailies that give you free NP and items, and by selling items to
other players on the market.

Outside of that, what you do is up to you. There's no clear goal to Neopets,
and I think that's why it manages to stick around. Maybe you want to train
a battling pet, by buying Codestones to pay for the Neopets training schools.
Maybe you want to make your Neopet read the most books, which requires buying
books that disappear after you read them. Maybe you just want to collect things
- the game has thousands of items and some people pride themselves on having a
good collection. Or you could get into the cosmetic side of things by buying
paintbrushes (which change the color of your Neopet) and decorations (which
you can have your Neopet wear).

Like I said. It's all up to you. What isn't up to you are the laws of supply
and demand. Neopets is basically a free market, modulo a few things, and where
there's demand, there's prices.


How do You Earn Neopoints?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Almost all MMOs have the same core problem. New players need to have a source of
income so that they can get started with building their wealth to buy things.
This income is usually provided by the game. In a standard MMORPG, monsters will
drop money on death, or drop other items you can sell to NPCs. In Neopets,
the game-provided income comes from playing games on the site.

The problem is that this doesn't shuffle money from one part of the economy to
the rest. It directly *adds* money to the system. In the long run, as more
money is added to the economy, the price of goods rises, since the worth of
1 Neopoint keeps dropping. If left unchecked, you can hit a situation where
it's impossible for new players to buy anything of value from enfranchised
players.
To slow down inflation, there need to be ways to remove money from the system.

The way Neopets handles this is actually pretty neat. In Neopets, the
majority of items come from NPC shops. Whenever a player buys an item from an
NPC shop, the money they spent is siphoned out of the economy.

Now, 99% of the stuff sold in NPC shops is useless, which is bad news for
a money sink, but Neopets happens to have ways to make these items occasionally
worth buying. There are several NPCs in Neopets that will give out quests.
Illusen quests, Jhudora quests, Edna quests, Brain Tree quests, Kitchen quests,
Faerie quests (if you get lucky). You could even go to the Faerieland Employment
agency to get a job, if you really want to. These quests (or jobs) ask for
random items that are sold in NPC shops, in exchange for rewards. This helps
provide a base level of demand for many items.

The way Neopets shops work is a bit special. When an item goes on sale, it sells
with a limited stock. When they run out of stock, the item isn't buyable
anymore, but shops restock every 7-8 minutes. These shops set a floor on the
market price of an item. Common items are almost always in stock at this floor
price. But what about rare items that sell out quickly?

Here, we see the economy in action. You can either wait for the rare item to
restock, and hope you buy it before other people do. Or, you can buy that
rare item directly from a user shop, but at a higher price that accounts for
the time spent buying that item from the NPC.

This leads to a practice called restocking. You sit at an NPC shop, refreshing
the page until rare items go on sale, buy them before other restockers, then
sell them at your shop for a profit. If you're lucky enough or patient enough,
this becomes one of the best ways to make NP in Neopets.

When I was growing up, I remember playing Neopets at the local library with
my friends, because they had just installed a super-fast Internet connection,
and in a Neopets restock war, milliseconds matter. It's an eerie analgoue to
the world of high-frequency trading today, except it was distributed over
millions of children.

As a kid, I thought it was magical that you could earn thousands or
tens of thousands of NP if you got a good sale. As an adult, I realize it's
purely a time-for-money tradeoff.

Note that sales between user shops don't add NP to the economy, so this is
a win-win from the game designer's side. New players get a way to bootstrap
their wallet in a way that removes NP from the overall economy, which helps
the overall new player experience.


Neopoint Inflation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Neopets system has all the tools needed to keep inflation in check. The
problem was simply a matter of balance. More NP was added than removed, and
over time, prices of various goods started to rise.

To combat this, the staff added more NP sinks to the system. Try the Lever
of Doom! If you pull it, you lose 100 NP. But, with a very small chance,
pulling the Lever of Doom grants you a special avatar to use on the message
boards. Some users are avatar hunters, trying to get every avatar they can,
and people have spent millions on the Lever of Doom.

Buy the Hidden Tower Grimoires! These are untradeable books, only buyable from
the Hidden Tower, the most expensive NPC shops in the game. They're called
the Grimoire of the First Order, the Grimoire of Prosperity, and the Grimoire
of Affluence, and cost 100,000 NP, 1,000,000 NP, and 10,000,000 NP respectively.
Reading each gives you an avatar. It also counts as a book read to your pet.
And some users go very hard on reading more books than any other user.

The problem with these NP sinks is that they only cater to specific groups
of users. Plenty of people don't care about avatars, or don't care about books.
What I find interesting is that *they were added in the first place.* You get
the feeling that people

They then added the Wheel of Extravangance. For 100,000 NP, you can spin the
wheel, and on average, you'll lose money but gain special items or avatars.

Eventually, this came to a head with the Save the Wheels initiative in (CHECK
YEAR). The in-lore storyline was that the Wheels of Excitement, NAME_CHECK,
were broken and needed renovations, so won't you please donate some
Neopoints, and as an added bonus we'll toss in rare items if you donate
a lot! The practical reason was that they desperately
needed to siphon money from the Neopets.

On the face of things, this is a bit ridiculous, but it actually *worked*.
Users donated over 12 *billion* Neopoints in total. In some sense, Neopets
is a zombie site, but the flip side of that is that users have directly seen
how prices of scarce items can shoot up over time, and they have the patience
to wait for their profit to appear.

Through it all, the Neopets economy has managed to stay remarkably stable.
I don't think this was guaranteed to happen. One worry some users had was that
as the game stagnated, players would leave, the supply of key consumables
would dry up, and the economy would collapse as a result. But this didn't
happen. In fact
Yes, the cost of some collectibles (like rare stamps and rare weapons) has
gone up over time.



At this point, I would like to call out one article in particular.

https://medium.com/nimbly-aware/the-bourgeoisie-online-a-review-of-the-neopets-economy-4963d0a0f845

You see, this isn't the first post about the Neopets economy. There have been
several over the years, but much of the motivation I had to write this article
came from this article in particular.

It criticizes the Neopets article from a socialistic standpoint, essentially
criticizing the economy for its similarities to broken economies of the past,
from a late-stage capitalism persepctive.
