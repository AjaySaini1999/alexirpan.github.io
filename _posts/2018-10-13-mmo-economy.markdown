When I was growing up, I bounced from MMO to MMO. I started on Neopets, then
moved to MapleStory, and Ragnarok Online after that.

The thing with MMOs is that they take a lot of time, which is abundant when
you're growing up and goes away later. I gave up MMOs by about the start of
high school. That being said, for nostalgia reasons I end up revisiting Neopets
and MapleStory every few years, and with the recent global release of
MapleStory 2, I figured I'd write a bit about the econommics lessons I learned
growing up.

I'd say the fundamental lesson I learned was the conversion of time into
in-game money.

The Neopets economy is actually pretty interesting. It's simplified enough that
you can say things about it with reasonably high certainty, but it has depth
to it as well. At the highest level, we can look at it from just two angles:
how do Neopoints get created, and how do Neopoints get removed?


Neopoint Creation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neopoints get created from the flash games hosted on the site. Depending on the
game and your skill level, you get 500-1000 NP per play, and can earn NP from a
game three times per day. There's a large suite of games to play, most of which
have aged poorly (or were never that good to begin with), but they still form
a steady stream of income. In the past, there were even sponsored flash games,
where companies would pay to have a game advertise their product. This ended up
being a virtuous cycle from the advertiser's perspective - these games were often
more generous with their NP than other games, making them popular attractions.

Neopoints also come from "dailies", the catch-all term for once-a-day pages that
give you free stuff when you visit them. Sometimes, a random event will give
you NP as well, but some random events will take NP away, so it's hard to tell
what the net effect is.

Neopoints also get created from interest in the Neopets Bank. Interestingly,
the more money you store in the Bank, the higher your interest rate is, up to
a cap of 10% per year if you store 10 million NP or more. In the real world,
banks want you to store your money so that they can make a profit by loaning
it out. In Neopets...well, there are no official loans. It's just a way to give
the players more stuff.


Neopoint Removal
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neopoints get removed from the economy when items get bought from NPC shops.
And actually, that's pretty much it. There are incidental fees here and there,
but shops are the primary fee.

(Actually, listing out the examples isn't that important compared to the
broader point: NP gets created faster than it can get removed.)
