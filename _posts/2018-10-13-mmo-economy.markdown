What is Neopets?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neopets is a website about Neopets, cute animals you can own as pets. The main
currency of Neopets is Neopoints, abbreviated NP. You earn NP from playing Flash
games, getting lucky from random events, and playing the market.

It was biggest in the early 2000s, then faded from relevance, but it's still
around. I like to check it out now and then, mostly for nostalgia reasons.

Outside of owning Neopets, what you do in the game is up to you.
There's no clear goal to Neopets, and I think that's why it manages to stick
around - everyone finds some goal that keeps them around. Some just play the
Flash games. Others become collectors of weird items. A few (like myself)
get into the battling scene, leveling up their pet at the Neopets training
schools and saving up Neopoints for powerful weapons.

Like I said. It's all up to you.

What isn't up to you are the laws of supply and demand. In the end, most goals
cost something, and any game that's run for 18 years is bound to have its share
of economic stories.


That Time Neopets Created a New Good by Changing Pet Art
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2007, the Neopets team standardized all Neopet artwork, such that all Neopets
of a species would have the same pose, regardless of color.
This was done to reduce the art load for a few features, like clothing. With
a standard pose, the clothes can simply be overlaid on top of the Neopet.
Many outfits are only buyable with NeoCash, the pay-to-win currency, so there
are some pretty clear monetary reasons involved.

This made some users very upset. A lot of users were drawn to their Neopets
because of what they looked like, and some felt that the new artwork lost some
of the charm and individuality of the old art. As a comparison, here is
some old artwork for the Darigan color.

Here is the new artwork for the same set of Neopets.

![jubjub new](/public/neopets-economy/new_darigan/jubjub.png)
{: .centered }

I don't think the new artwork is universally better or worse than the old art.
It's all up to opinion.

Not all the new art was ready at launch time of the switch.
on the pet and color combination, some pets kept their old art. The community
started calling them unconverted pets, or UC pets for short. The Neopets team
did not undo the conversion, but they did make any further pet conversion
optional.

Every new pet is defaulted to the new artwork, which makes UC pets impossible
to create. When there's demand and a fixed supply that's never going to increase,
speculators are going to show up. Owning a UC pet is a status symbol, and
although some genuinely prefer the old art, others simply treat them as a
valuable bargaining chip in the pet trading market.

You can read more about this topic from [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/2xpejk/so_whats_the_deal_with_unconverted_neopets/)
and [the Neopets wiki](http://neopets.wikia.com/wiki/Unconverted). When
researching this, I even found a page where [you can buy UC pets](https://neopointsdeals.com/neopets/buy-unconverted-neopets/), with classifications based on how well the Neopet is named. I
find this ridiculous, yet excellent.


That Time People Abused a Duplication Glitch and Crashed the High-End Economy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2014, Neopets was sold from Viacom to JumpStart. During the transition period,
the site was lagging horribly, and a bunch of things...just stopped working.

> Games: broken (HSTs not reset)
> 
> Restocking: broken (only restocking once an hour or so)
> 
> User shops: a little broken (overstocking)
> 
> Battledome: broken forever (not really, it's just a little glitchy)
> 
> Keyquest: still broken (broken since transition)
> 
> Contests (Art Gallery, Random Contest, etc.): broken (submissions don't work)
> 
> Galleries: broken (you can add/remove but you can't rank)
> 
> Petpages: NEIN NEIN NEIN (you cannot edit petpages. at all. no petpages for you.)
> 
> Neomail: bit messy (neomails displaying as "read" instead of "replied")
> 
> Wishing Well: worst genie ever (has not granted wishes in days)
>
> Employment Agency: everyone is on state benefits (no job listings)
> 
> Guilds: pretty broken (rank names and layouts can not be edited)
> 
> Pound: having numerous issues. (adopting neopets is not a good idea right now)
> 
> Our hearts: broken (TNT WHYYYYYYYY)

{: .centered }

During the lag, a few users discovered that if you sent a bunch of requests at
a fast enough rate, the servers would get confused and duplicate items.
Several Neopets items cost hundreds of millions of Neopoints, and a few trolls
started duplicating items and selling them at deliberately low prices.

The following pictures come from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/8wyqpl/neopets_history_the_2014_dday_dupe_day/) and [here](http://neopointsdeals.com/neopets-dupe-day-2014/).

Then it got worse when people started releasing scripts to automate the process.

![Dupe program](/public/neopets-economy/dupe_program.png)
{: .centered }

You have to imagine how disappointed some cheaters were. Here they are, trying
to silently exploit a glitch to make millions, and then the trolls show up and
ruin everything by deliberately crashing the market. The glitch got patched
immediately.

And by immediately, I mean 4 days later.

Also, they didn't rollback the servers. Instead, they banned the abused, removed
all the obvious-looking duplicates, and warned that anyone taking advantage of
the glitch may be banned. Combine this with the knowledge that it takes months
to hear back from Neopets support for improper bannings, and it was natural
that some people got a bit paranoid.

![Please remove](/public/neopets-economy/dupe_remove.png)
{: .centered }

Now, there are reasons not to do a rollback. It's a nuclear option that's very
disruptive for the end-user. However, it's also one of the few ways to guarantee
invalid items are no longer in circulation. You can adopt smell tests based on
whether the price is too good to be true, or if the account seems too young to
have a good item, but once a dupe gets laundered by a few users, it's hard to
identify it as a dupe.

Ironically, by avoiding the nuclear option, the Neopets team ended up
creating a radioactive fallout around high-end items. It took several months
before people felt safe buying these items. It's almost certain that not all
dupes are gone, but what can you do? Super Attack Peas used to be over 1 billion
NP and now they're about one-fourth of the price. It's hard to know for sure,
since Trading Post sales aren't public.


That Time Neopets Decreased Sale Friction and Prices Dropped Accordingly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a long, long, long, looooooooooong time, the max price of items in user shops
was 99,999 NP. For anything more expensive, you had to sell on the Auction House
or Trading Post. In practice, the Auction House is only used to close already
agreed-upon deals from the Trading Post, leaving the Trading Post (or TP) as
the de-facto selling ground.

When I played more actively, I found this very annoying, because it takes so
much longer to buy items from the Trading Post. Here's how you buy items from
shops.

* Go to the Shop Wizard and search for your item.
* It gives you listings in order of lowest price.
* Buy cheapest one.
* The transaction happens immediately.

Here's how the Trading Post works.

* Go to the Trading Post and search for your item
* It gives you listings where people write how much they want, except most people just say "neomail me offers", which makes it hard to figure out the market price.
* You haggle with the seller in an email back-and-forth, over a few hours or days.
* Then you finally get the item.

In short, there's a lot of friction. There's also information asymmetry. When
a deal closes, only the people involved in that transaction know it happened.
This incentivizes sellers to ask for more NP than the item is actually worth,
because it's hard to prove it's inaccurate. It's a seller-favored platform,
compared to the buyer-favored platform of the Shop Wizard.

Recently, the max shop price was increased from 99,999 NP to 999,999 NP. It was
a great change that improved accessbility of several items, leading to price
drops across the board for several items.

> I think the thing most people don't realize is that honestly, it hasn't caused items to go down in value, these are what the values truly should have been.

I was selling Turned Tooths at the time, a powerful budget weapon, and it was
pretty amazing to see all the Turned Tooths disappear from the Trading Post.
There was some price memory where Trading Post listings were asking for
150,000 NP to 200,000 NP, but I knew they were really hard to sell at above
100,000 NP. Once the Shop Wizard made the true price obvious, there was no
reason to use the Trading Post anymore.


That Time a Book Got 1000 Times More Expensive Because of Charity
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a secret about Neopets: 99% of the items are useless.

Despite this, some useless items still have high prices, because of their
rarity. Neopets has a built-in rarity system, explained [here](http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=item_rarities_explained).
For our purposes, the important rarities are rarities 1-99. These items are
sold form NPC shops, and the rarity defines how often that item is in stock.
Rarity 99 items restock very rarely, so all of them command large prices. Many
users like trying to collect all rarity 99 items in the game.

Let's talk about the Charity Corner. It's a yearly event where you can donate
donate gifts to Neopians who need it. Awwwww.

The way it works changes each year, but here's how it worked in 2015 and 2017.
They defined three rarity bands: r70-79, r80-89, and r90-99. They announced
a category, like books. For every five books you donate, you get a random item
sampled from the rarity band you donated.

For example, you donate five rarity 90 books, and you get a randomm item from
rarity 90 to 99. This sampling didn't seem to be weighted by rarity, which
gave decent chances of getting a rarity 99 item, and there are a lot of cheap
items in the low 90s.

No surprises for what happened next: users began buying out the cheapest rarity 90
items they could find, swarming to the next cheapest item once other users
adjusted their prices accordingly.

JellyNeo tracks historical logs of item prices. Here's the price log for
[Realm of the Water Faeries], a rarity 92 book. Can you guess when Charity
Corner ran that year?

![Price increase from 45 NP to 50000 NP](/public/neopets-economy/charity2015.png)
{: .centered }

Here's the 2017 spike, with a more modest spike of 100x instead of 1000x.

![Price increase from 300 NP to 30000 NP](/public/neopets-economy/charity2017.png)
{: .centered }

This also increased the supply of Illusen's Staff and Wand of the Dark Faeries,
two of the strongest weapons in the game. These items are obtainable from a chain of NPC quests called the
Illusen quests and Jhudora quests. Each day, they ask for an item. Succeed
50 days in a row, and you get the weapon. Fail once, and you have to start all
over. As you get cloesr to 50, they start asking only for rarity 99 items.
More r99 items led to more completed quests, which led to more weapons in the
market, and long story short, the price of a Wand of the Dark Faerie has dropped
from [350 million NP in 2009 to 40 million NP now](https://items.jellyneo.net/item/14896/price-history/).


That Time A User Donated a Billion Neopoints to Help Save the Economy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

All MMO economies are defined by their sources and sinks. How does in-game
currency get created, and how does it get deleted?

Take MapleStory, a game I played a lot in my youth. Monsters drops money on
death, buying healing items from NPC makes that money disappear, and whenever
you trade with a user, a small percentage of the transaction is taken as tax.

Why does this tax exist? The more monsters players killed, the more money
enters the economy. In MapleStory, the in-game currency is called Mesos. The
more Mesos there are, the less buying power each Mesos has. The tax helps
keep inflation in check by removing Mesos from the overall economy.

In Neopets, Neopoints enter the system through Flash games, and leave from NPC
shops and various gambling games. There's no transaction tax, so inflation
is only held in check by whether users spend money at NPC shops or not.

People do use these shops. Remember that NPC shops restock items of varying
rarities. The NPC price for rare items is much lower than the true market price,
leading to a practice called restocking. You refresh a shop page until
rare items appear in stock, buy them for cheap, then sell them to users at
a much higher price.

As a kid, I thought restocking was magical. I played Neopets with my friends
at the local library, because my local library had a super fast Internet
connection. In a Neopets restock war, milliseconds matter. It was basically
high-frequency trading, except performed by millions of children instead of bots.

As an adult, I now recognize the profit from restocking is basically the
equivalent of scalping. There's arbitrage between the NPC market and the
user market and you're getting compensated for the time spent.

From a game design point, scalping is actually good for the game, since it gives
new players another way to earn Neopoints. But the low NPC shop prices
did mean that NP was accumulating in the economy faster than it should.

Recognizing the problem, the Neopets team added new Neopoint sinks to the
economy. Here are two I like a lot.

**The Lever of Doom:** Pulling this lever makes you lose 100 NP. That's all it
does.

![Lever of Doom](/public/neopets-economy/leverofdoom.gif)
{: .centered }

Why would you even pull this lever? Well,
every pull has
a small probability of giving you a Lever of Doom avatar you can use on the
Neopets message boards. That was enough to get avatar hunters to spend
millions of NP chasing the avatar.

![Lever of Doom Avatar](/public/neopets-economy/leveravatar.gif)
{: .centered }

Would you pay for this? I wouldn't. But you do you.


**The Hidden Tower Grimoires:** The Hidden Tower is the most expensive NPC
shop in the game, selling items for millions of NP. Unlike other shops, all
Hidden Tower items are always in stock. This reverses the dynamic - most
Hidden Tower items are buyable from users at a slight discount from the base
price. Bad for inflation, since users don't spend money at the NPC store.

The Hidden Tower Grimoires are books, and unlike the other Hidden Tower
items, they're entirely untradeable. You can only buy them from the Hidden
Tower, with the most expensive one costing 10,000,000 NP.
Each book grants an avatar when read, disappearing on use.

{: .centered }

Remember the story of the [I Am Rich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich)
iOS app, that cost $1000, and did literally nothing? Buying the most expensive
Grimoire for the avatar is just pure conspicuous consumption.
I think these avatars were actually a pretty smart move. They target the top 1%
by creating a new status symbol.

Alone, these two weren't enough, so in 2010, the team decided to go all out, with
a month-long **Save the Wheels Campaign**.

![Save the Wheels](/public/neopets-economy/savethewheels.jpg)
{: .centered }

The Wheels are a site feature where you pay a small NP fee to spin a wheel to
get prizes. They've been around since the start of the game, and they needed
a visual rework.

Seeing an opporunity, the rework was branded as a renovation project. Users
who donated Neopoints would receive thank-you gifts from the Neopian Conservation
Society, and the top 10 donaters would be listed on a public leaderboard.
The most expensive thank-you gift required donating 2,000,000 NP at once.

There are lots of user stories about people who come back to the site, dig
through their storage, and discover an item (like a stamp they got from
an event ten years ago) is now worth millions of Neopoints, because it's part
of a stamp album that stamp collectors want and they were only given out
ten years. Any time there's an event that gives out items which will never be
given again, you can be sure that some users will get as many as they can as
a long-term investment strategy.

You can see the final tally at the offical [Neopets page](http://www.neopets.com/savethewheels/)
for the event. Users donated 12,371,694,534 NP in total, with the top user
donating over a billion NP by themselves.

![Billion NP](/public/neopets-economy/billion.png)
{: .centered }

And okay, sure, it's not like they asked users to donate NP for the good of the
economy. It was in exchange for stuff that speculators wanted. But I still
find the entire event very amusing.


\* \* \*
{: .centered }

There isn't really a point to this post. It was mostly an excuse for me to dig
up Neopets history. But if I had to make one, it would be that it's very, very
hard to escape economics. It has
this nasty habit of showing up everywhere you look.

There have been other posts about the Neopets economy. There's
[this one about inflation](https://www.themarysue.com/neopets-economy/),
and [this one about the dangers of unrestricted capitalism](https://medium.com/nimbly-aware/the-bourgeoisie-online-a-review-of-the-neopets-economy-4963d0a0f845).

In one sense, yes, there's definitely a Neopets top 1%, that barters in
millions while others are earning 5000 NP a day. As noted by [this editorial](http://www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=468018&week=412), this top 1% barely interacts with the
Neopets proletariat (which is certainly not a phrase I ever expected to write).
There's definitely some uneasiness with how much more the wealthiest users have.

On the other hand, Neopets doesn't cost anything to play. Feeding your Neopets
costs 5 NP a day. The Flash games are entirely free to play. The strongest
criticism of unrestricted capitalism is that some are forced into terrible
conditions to earn enough to live, but this just isn't a thing in Neopets,
since the cost of living is zero.

Sure, not everyone on Neopets has what they want. But Neopets is a game. It
only works as a game *because* it requires effort to get many of things it
offers. If there's no challenge in getting things in the game, why would
anyone play it?

A similar sentiment was explained in this profanity-filled
[Zero Punctuation review of Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wgQvij3rVE).

> If you can just clap your hands and summon fifty explosive barrels, the spectacle
> is as fulfilling as eating your own snot. Minecraft is a responsible parent.
> It knows you'll swiftly get bored if you just get whatever you want, so it pays you
> five dollars a week to wash its cars so that you can gain an appreciation
> for value.

I'd hesitate to generalize any lessons from the Neopets economy to the real
world economy. There are too many differences for the comparison to have value.
If anything does transfer, it's that we like having goals, something to aim for
that takes work to achieve. And, it's that not everyone can get what they want.
Not the happiest ending, but what do you expect out of the dismal science?
