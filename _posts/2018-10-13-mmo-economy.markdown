I've been playing a lot of MapleStory 2 recently, mostly out of nostalgia for
MapleStory 1. I played several MMOs when I was growing up. I never got into
Runescape, or Kingdom of Loathing, two popular MMOs in my age range, but I did
get into Neopets, moved on to MapleStory, then Ragnarok Online after that.

Out of all of those, I'd say Neopets was the most formative MMO. Sure, in terms
of game hours spent, I've probably spent more time on Ragnarok Online or
MapleStory. But Neopets was my *first* MMO, and it was a browser game, making it
easy to play anywhere. The local library had a super-fast Internet connection,
and several of us signed up for computer time for the sole purpose of getting
an edge in Neopets restocking.

It's only with the benefit of hindsight that I can appreciate the economies
that evolved in those MMOs, and in some ways they're actually quite elegant.
They're simpler than real-world economies, but still have solid depth to them.

This post is focused on the Neopets economy, because I understand that
economy better, and after running for over 18 years, you naturally end up with
lots of interesting stories.


What is Neopets?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neopets is a website about Neopets, which are cute animals you can own. You can
buy things for your Neopet with Neopoints (NP), the main currency of the site.
You get Neopoints from playing games, getting lucky from random events, doing
dailies that give you NP, and by selling items to other players.

The thing with Neopets is that you have to make your own goals. Luckily, there
are enough options that you can do a lot of things. Maybe you want to read the
most books, earn a trophy for a game by getting the top score, or collect
stamps, or train your pet so that it can compete in the Battledome, or paint
your Neopet a specific color. Whatever the goal, it usually costs Neopoints
to get there, and that's where the economy comes in.


Inflows and Outflows
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A lot of MMOs run into a similar problem. New players need to have a source of
income so that they can save up and buy the things they want. But there also
need to be ways to remove money from the system, to help reduce inflation.

The way Neopets handles this is actually pretty neat. There are a ton of NPC
shops in Neopets, selling all sorts of stuff, 99% of which has no intrinsic
value. Seriously. But, there are also a bunch of NPC quests that use these
random items. Faeries quests ask for all sorts of knick knacks. Edna,
Kitchen, Esophaghar, and Brain Tree quests also ask for all sorts of things.

That provides the reason to buy items for NPC shops. Common items are almost
always in stock, and the NPC shops set a floor on the market price. But what
about the rare items? Here, we see the economy in action. You can either
wait for the rare item to reappear in stock, or you can buy them directly
from a user shop at a premium.

This leads to a practice the community calls restocking. You sit at an NPC
shop, continually refresh it until rare items reappear in stock, buy them
before other restockers get them, and then sell them in your shop at a profit.

As a kid, I thought it was magical that you could earn thousands or
tens of thousands of NP if you got a good sale. As an adult, I realize it's
basically a time-for-money tradeoff.

Restocking is entirely condoned by the site, and they even included a
restocking penalty, where if you refreshed a shop page too often, you were
locked out of buying items for several minutes. This helped mitigate bots.

Why do I bring up restocking? It's the main engine for removing Neopoints
from the economy! NP spent at NPC shops goes away forever, and NP exchanging
between users doesn't add any extra NP to the system. If restockers spend
enough money at NPC shops, Neopoint inflation should be held in check.

If.

Turns out that didn't happen.


Neopoint Inflation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Neopets system has all the tools needed to keep inflation in check. The
problem was simply a matter of balance. More NP was added than removed, and
over time, prices of various goods started to rise.
Now, there have been several articles about Neopets inflation in the past.

ADD LINKS.

These all point at it from the angle of late-stage capitalism.




Right away, there's an elegance to this. To train your Neopet, you can either
wait until the Tombola gives you the random Codestone you need, or you can
pay NP and buy a Codestone sold by another player. Money for time, in one of
its purest forms.


* Books, which disappear when read. There are trophies for reading
the most books.
* NPC Quests, like Kitchen Quest, the Brain Tree, and Faerie Quests, all of
which give you bonuses for random knickknacks.
