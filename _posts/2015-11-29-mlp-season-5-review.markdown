This was a worrying season. Not because the episodes were bad, but because
the episodes were astoundingly good.

When watching *Friendship is Magic*, you always need to remember that it's
intended to be a kids show. Because of that, it can be frustrating to see
episodes that rely heavily on kids show stereotypes, or episodes that are
as blunt as a hammer in their moralizing. Every season has a few episodes
that are duds, which makes this season 5 so surprising. In retrospect, very
few episodes fell flat for me. There were certainly mediocre ones, but on
average this might be the highest quality season yet. (I'm considering season
2 over this one, but that might be nostalgia talking.)

That's what's so worrying.
Everything about this show and this fandom feels like it should be ending
soon. I mean, the 100th episode of MLP aired this year. The five year anniversary
of the show aired this year too. Both season 6 and a feature length movie have
been greenlit, and it's hard for me to see how the show staff can keep the
heart of the show alive after all these years. After five seasons of character
development, some ponies are unrecognizably different, and yet they still
stay true to their roots. Similar strengths, similar flaws, but just different
enough to keep things interesting.

I have mixed feeligns on season 5's finale, and definitely think it's
one of the weaker ones. It feels like the show blew all its
serial escalation on the explosively good season 4 finale, and although that
shouldn't be a slight against season 5, it still colors my perception of the
comparatively weaker action and adventure. It's a lot like
Breaking Bad season 4 compared to the first half of Breaking Bad season 5.
Both are good, but I naturally compare episodes to the previous season, not
to The Absolute Scale Of TV Quality. Luckily for season 5, its weaker
adventure is counterbalanced by the heart in its slice of life episodes.
The guiding seasonal theme was executed very well, and led to a
lot of touching scenes that felt natural and genuine.

More than anything else, season 5 shows the staff isn't afraid to try something
new. Episodes have deeper continuity. Tons of status quo was told to buck
right off. The envelope wasn't just pushed, it was shoved beyond recognition.

It's a great sign for season 6. I don't know if they can keep the charm that's
kept me watching the show, but this time I'll give the benefit of the doubt.
