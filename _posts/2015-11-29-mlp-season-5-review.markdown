*Very minor spoilers for season 5, use your own judgment.*

This was a worrying season. Not because the episodes were bad, but because
the episodes were surprisingly good.

When watching *Friendship is Magic*, you always need to remember it's
a kids show first. It can be frustrating to see
episodes relying heavily on kids show stereotypes, or episodes that are
as blunt as a hammer in their moralizing. Every season has a few episodes
that are duds, which makes season 5 so surprising. In retrospect, very
few episodes fell flat for me. There were certainly mediocre ones, but on
average this might be the highest quality season yet. It's a tough call
between seasons 2, 4, and 5.

That's what worries me.
Everything about this show and this fandom feels like its living on borrowed time.
I mean, the 100th episode aired this year. The five year anniversary
of the show aired this year. A full length season 6 is confirmed, and a
feature length movie that isn't a crappy high school spinoff is in production.
It's hard to see how the show staff kept the
heart of the show alive after all these years, but they have.
Five seasons of character development later, some ponies do things they never
would have done in season 1, and yet they still
stay true to their roots. Similar strengths, similar flaws, and just different
enough to keep things interesting. The future of the show depends on their
continued success, and although a crash feels inevitable, for now the
hype train keeps rolling.

I have mixed feelings on season 5's finale, and it's definitely weaker than the
rest.
The show blew all its
serial escalation on the explosively good season 4 finale, and although that
shouldn't be a slight against season 5, it still colors my perception of the
action and adventure this season. It's a lot like
*Breaking Bad* season 4 and the first half of *Breaking Bad* season 5.
Both are good, but I compare episodes to the previous season, not
to some Absolute Scale Of TV Quality. Luckily for season 5, its weaker
adventure is counterbalanced by the heart in its slice of life episodes.
The guiding theme this season was executed very well, and led to a
lot of touching scenes that felt natural and genuine.

More than anything else, this season shows the staff isn't afraid to try something
new. Episodes have deeper continuity, tons of status quo was told to buck
right off, and the envelope wasn't just pushed, it was shoved beyond recognition.

Welcome back to *My Little Pony*. Here's *a desolate wasteland with no civilization*.

It's a great sign for season 6. I don't know if they can keep the charm that's
kept me watching the show, but this time I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.
