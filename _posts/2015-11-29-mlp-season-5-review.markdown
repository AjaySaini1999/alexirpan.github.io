*Very minor spoilers for season 5, use your own judgment.*

This was a worryingly good season.

When watching *Friendship is Magic*, you always need to remember it's
a kids show first. It can be frustrating to see
episodes relying heavily on kids show stereotypes, or episodes that are
as blunt as a hammer in their moralizing. Every season has a few episodes
that are duds, which makes season 5 so surprising. In retrospect, very
few episodes fell flat for me. There were certainly mediocre ones, but on
average this might be the highest quality season yet.

That's why I'm worried.
Everything about this show and this fandom feels like its living on borrowed time.
I mean, the 100th episode aired this year. The five year anniversary
of the show aired this year. A full length season 6 is confirmed, and a
feature length movie is in production.
It's hard to believe the show staff kept the
heart of the show alive after all these years, but they have.
My favorite episode of the series aired this season, for crying out loud! (And
I thought nothing was going to top *Pinkie Pride* from season 4.)
Five seasons later, the jokes are still good and ponies are still subtly
changing for the better.
A crash feels inevitable, but for now the
hype train keeps rolling.

That isn't to say this season was perfect.
I have mixed feelings on season 5's finale, and on its action in general.
The show blew all its
serial escalation on the explosively good season 4 finale, and although that
shouldn't be a slight against season 5, it still colors my perception of the
action and adventure this season. It's a lot like
*Breaking Bad* season 4 and the first half of *Breaking Bad* season 5.
Both are good, but I compare episodes to the previous season, not
to some Absolute Scale Of TV Quality. Luckily for season 5, its weaker
adventure is counterbalanced by the heart in its slice of life episodes.
The guiding theme this season was executed very well, and led to a
lot of touching scenes that felt natural and genuine.

More than anything else, this season shows the staff isn't afraid to try something
new. Episodes have deeper continuity, tons of status quo was told to buck
right off, and the envelope wasn't just pushed, it was shoved beyond recognition.

Welcome back to *My Little Pony*. Here's *a desolate wasteland with no civilization*. For kids!

It's a great sign for season 6. I don't know if they can keep the charm that's
kept me watching the show, but this time I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.
