Did you know there's a brony music scene?

It's a really weird music scene. It had its heyday around Season 2 and Season
3, when MLP was A Big Thing on the Internet. Since then, it's
quieted down, but the music scene is certainly still going.
As a sign of the times it came from, the songs lean heavily towards techno
and dubstep.

The scene has some similarities to the Touhou music scene, except for a few
important differences. There are fewer original songs to work with, meaning
several songs are actually entirely original pieces, rather than arranges of
existing songs. More importantly, Hasbro cares a lot more about copyright.
This makes it a lot harder for musicians to profit off their work.
Finally, many of the artists are one-hit wonders - they made a few very
popular songs, and then moved on from the fandom.

I would on average recommend a Touhou song over an MLP song, but there's still
some cool stuff out there.

To keep this recs list shorter, every artist gets at most one song. In some
cases, the original artist changed their label - in these cases I use their
label name at the time the song was released.
