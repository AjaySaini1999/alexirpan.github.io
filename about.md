*Last updated February 14, 2018.*

I currently work at Google as a Software
Engineer on the Brain Robotics team. The views expressed on this blog are
personal opinions, and do not reflect the opinions of my employer.

My main research interest is deep reinforcement learning. Recently, I've
done work in transfer learning for robotics. I like thinking about what's
necessary to make deep RL applicable to more real-world problems.

Before joining Google, I was an undergrad at UC Berkeley.
In 2016, I graduated from the Computer Science program with a 4.0 in major GPA.
At Berkeley, I did undergraduate research in the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence
Research (BAIR) Lab](http://bair.berkeley.edu/),
mentored by [Pieter Abbeel](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) and
working most closely with [John Schulman](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~joschu/).
I was also a TA for [CS 70](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs70),
the introductory discrete math and probability course.

In 2016, I was an Honorable Mention for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship
Program.

As someone who started as a math major, I've always had a soft spot for
theoretical computer science. Outside of machine learning, I enjoy
complexity theory, theoretical cryptography, and mathematical logic.

This site double as my personal blog.
Posts range from explanations of research papers to observations
of my life and stupid jokes. I post whenever I have the time and motivation to
do so, meaning not very often. Historically I average about one post per
month.

In my free time, I primarily play card games, play video games, or participate
in puzzle hunts.
My main game is Dominion, which I play competitively. At my best, I was in
the top 20 worldwide. I'm also prone to joining fandoms. For now, I watch
*My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic* and listen to a lot of Touhou music.
