*Last updated May 4, 2017.*

In 2016, I graduated from the Computer Science undergraduate program at UC
Berkeley, with a 4.0 in major GPA. I currently work at Google on the Brain
Robotics team.

My main research interests are deep reinforcement learning, transfer learning,
and multitask learning.

At Berkeley, I did undergraduate research in the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence
Research (BAIR) Lab](http://bair.berkeley.edu/),
mentored by [Pieter Abbeel](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) and
working most closely with [John Schulman](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~joschu/).
I was also a TA for [CS 70](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs70),
the introductory discrete math and probability course.

In 2016, I was an Honorable Mention for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship
Program.

As someone who started as a math major, I've always had a soft spot for
theoretical computer science. Outside of machine learning, I enjoy
complexity theory, theoretical cryptography, and mathematical logic.

Blog posts range from explanations of research papers to observations
of my life and stupid jokes.
I post whenever I have the time to, meaning not very often.
(Disclaimer: the views expressed here are my own, not those of my employer.)

I play Dominion competitively,
watch lots of *My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic*, and like participating in
puzzle hunts.
