*Last updated September 25, 2017.*

In 2016, I graduated from the Computer Science undergraduate program at UC
Berkeley, with a 4.0 in major GPA. I currently work at Google as a Software
Engineer on the Brain Robotics team. The views expressed on this blog are
personal opinions, and do not reflect the opinions of my employer.

My main research interests are deep reinforcement learning, transfer learning,
and multitask learning.

At Berkeley, I did undergraduate research in the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence
Research (BAIR) Lab](http://bair.berkeley.edu/),
mentored by [Pieter Abbeel](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) and
working most closely with [John Schulman](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~joschu/).
I was also a TA for [CS 70](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs70),
the introductory discrete math and probability course.

In 2016, I was an Honorable Mention for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship
Program.

As someone who started as a math major, I've always had a soft spot for
theoretical computer science. Outside of machine learning, I enjoy
complexity theory, theoretical cryptography, and mathematical logic.

Posts range from explanations of research papers to observations
of my life and stupid jokes. I post whenever I have the time to, meaning not
very often, but historically I average about one post per month.

In my free time, I like playing Dominion competitively. At my best, I was in
the top 25 worldwide. I'm currentl ranked 62nd.
I also watch *My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic*, and like participating
in puzzle hunts.
