*Last updated February 25, 2016.*

I'm a fourth year undergraduate at UC Berkeley majoring in computer science.
Currently, I do undergraduate research in the [Robot Learning Lab](http://rll.berkeley.edu/outreach/),
mentored by [Pieter Abbeel](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) and
working most closely with [John Schulman](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~joschu/).
My main research area is deep reinforcement learning. In the past, I was an
undergraduate student instructor for [CS 70](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs70),
the introductory discrete math and probability class.

As someone who entered Berkeley as a math major, I've always had a fondness
for theoretical computer science. I'm motivated the most when I'm exploring
new algorithm or model designs for reinforcement learning, and enjoy
work more when it has a healthy amount of theory.

Besides machine learning, my other technical interests are a grab bag of complexity theory,
theoretical cryptography, and mathematical logic.

This site also doubles as my personal blog. I post about anything I want to
write, meaning posts range from explanations of research papers to dumb jokes.

I post whenever I have the time, but school takes priority, so that means
I don't post very often.

My non-technical interests are all over the place, but I usually get
very deep into a few interests at a time. Right now, the biggest ones
are My Little Pony, the competitive Dominion community, and the
Smash Bros. fandom.

Projects page and research page coming soon.
