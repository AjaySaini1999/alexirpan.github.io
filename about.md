I'm an undergrad at UC Berkeley majoring in computer science. However, I'm
secretly a math major, so I'm more interested in theoretical computer
science. My technical interests are some mix of algorithms, machine learning,
probability, complexity theory, and recreational math.

My non-technical interests are all over the place, but usually involve
getting very deep into a few fandoms at a time.

For side projects, see my github repo. I'll try to make posts for new projects,
but suspect I won't have time to do all of them.
