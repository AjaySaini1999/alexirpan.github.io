*Last updated June 10, 2016.*

I'm about to graduate from UC Berkeley, majoring in computer science.
At Berkeley, I did undergraduate research in the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence
Research (BAIR) Lab](http://bair.berkeley.edu/),
mentored by [Pieter Abbeel](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) and
working most closely with [John Schulman](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~joschu/).
My main research area is deep reinforcement learning, which combines
deep neural nets and reinforcement learning to learn good strategies from
minimal domain knowledge.

In 2016, I was an Honorable Mention for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship
Program. I am currently working at Google as a Google Brain Resident.

In the past, I interned at Robinhood, Facebook, and Khan Academy.
I was also a TA for [CS 70](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs70),
the introductory discrete math and probability course.

As someone who started as a math major, I've always liked
theoretical computer science. Outside machine learning, I enjoy
complexity theory, theoretical cryptography, and mathematical logic.

This site doubles as my personal blog.
(Disclaimer: the views expressed here are my own, not those of my employer.)
I write whatever I feel like writing
about, meaning posts range from explanations of research papers to observations
of my life and dumb jokes.
I post whenever I have the time to, meaning not very often.

For non-technical interests, I get very deep into a few things
at a time. Right now, the biggest ones
are My Little Pony, competitive Dominion, hard platforming games, and puzzle
hunts.
