*Last updated March 5, 2016.*

I'm a fourth year undergraduate at UC Berkeley majoring in computer science.
Currently, I do undergraduate research in the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence
Research (BAIR) Lab](http://bair.berkeley.edu/),
mentored by [Pieter Abbeel](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) and
working most closely with [John Schulman](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~joschu/).
My main research area is deep reinforcement learning, which combines
deep neural nets and reinforcement learning to learn good strategies from
minimal domain knowledge.
In the past, I was a TA for [CS 70](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs70),
the introductory discrete math and probability course.

As someone who entered Berkeley as a math major, I've always had a fondness
for theoretical computer science. Besides machine learning, my other technical
interests are a grab bag of complexity theory, theoretical cryptography, and mathematical logic.

This site is also my personal blog. I post about anything I want to
write, meaning posts range from explanations of research papers to dumb jokes.
I post whenever I have the time, so unfortunately I don't post very often.
School takes priority.

My non-technical interests are all over the place, but I usually get
very deep into a few interests at a time. Right now, the biggest ones
are My Little Pony, competitive Dominion, Super Smash Bros., and puzzle
hunts.

Research page coming soon.
