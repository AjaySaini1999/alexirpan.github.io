*Last updated June 11, 2016.*

In 2016, I graduated from the Computer Science undergraduate program at UC
Berkeley, with a 4.0 in major GPA. I currently work at Google as a
Google Brain Resident.

At Berkeley, I did undergraduate research in the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence
Research (BAIR) Lab](http://bair.berkeley.edu/),
mentored by [Pieter Abbeel](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) and
working most closely with [John Schulman](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~joschu/).
My main research area is deep reinforcement learning, which combines
deep neural nets and reinforcement learning to learn good strategies from
minimal domain knowledge.
I was also a TA for [CS 70](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs70),
the introductory discrete math and probability course.

In 2016, I was an Honorable Mention for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship
Program.

As someone who started as a math major, I've always liked
theoretical computer science. Outside machine learning, I enjoy
complexity theory, theoretical cryptography, and mathematical logic.

This site doubles as my personal blog.
Posts range from explanations of research papers to observations
of my life and stupid jokes.
I post whenever I have the time to, meaning not very often.
(Disclaimer: the views expressed here are my own, not those of my employer.)

I play Dominion competitively (ranked 25th worldwide),
watch lots of *My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic*, and participate in many
puzzle hunts. To find other things that make me weird, browse the site.
I'm sure you'll turn up something.
