Touhou is many things. A video game series where poorly drawn magical girls
shoot bullets at one another. A series of music albums that happens to come
with a game. An ever-growing universe filled with story potential.
But what defines Touhou the most is its insanely dedicated fandom. In any
discussion about fandom, Touhou's fandom is the gold standard.

I got into Touhou around high school, and never got out of it. What kept me
invested was the music. There's a vibrant doujin music community all built
around the Touhou soundtracks. Somehow, a pile of MIDI files inspired
people to pick up guitars, lay down tracks, and (in one case) hire a
symphony with Latin choir.

For every genre of music I listen to, I was introduced to that genre through
Touhou. That isn't a joke. It's fact.

Here are songs I ilke. To keep this list short, every circle gets at
most one song. Some circles are one hit wonders, and some produce masterpiece
after masterpiece (looking at you Demetori), but in this they all get
equal representation.
