Touhou is many things. A video game series made by a composer who can't draw.
An ever-growing mythology with near infinite story capacity. But what defines
Touhou the most is its insanely large fandom. When you talk about the craziness
of fandom, Touhou's is the gold standard.

I got into Touhou around high school, and never got out of it. What kept me
invested was the music. There's a vibrant doujin community, where people can
actually make a living off of selling remixes of music from the Touhou games.
This is completely absurd and I love it. I was introduced to every genre of
music through Touhou. That's not a joke.

Here are songs I ilke. To keep this list short, every circle gets at
most one song. Some circles are one hit wonders, and some produce masterpiece
after masterpiece (looking at you Demetori), but in this they all get
equal representation.
